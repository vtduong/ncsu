was
crossing
himself
with
his
right
hand
turning
his
eyes
upward
each
time
he
touched
his
forehead
His
face
wore
a
calm
look
of
piety
and
resignation
to
the
will
of
God
If
you
do
not
understand
these
sentiments
he
seemed
to
be
saying
so
much
the
worse
for
you
Behind
him
stood
the
aide
de
camp
the
doctors
and
the
menservants
the
men
and
women
had
separated
as
in
church
All
were
silently
crossing
themselves
and
the
reading
of
the
church
service
the
subdued
chanting
of
deep
bass
voices
and
in
the
intervals
sighs
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
were
the
only
sounds
that
could
be
heard
Anna
Mikhaylovna
with
an
air
of
importance
that
showed
that
she
felt
she
quite
knew
what
she
was
about
went
across
the
room
to
where
Pierre
was
standing
and
gave
him
a
taper
He
lit
it
and
distracted
by
observing
those
around
him
began
crossing
himself
with
the
hand
that
held
the
taper
Sophie
the
rosy
laughter
loving
youngest
princess
with
the
mole
watched
him
She
smiled
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
remained
with
it
hidden
for
awhile
then
looking
up
and
seeing
Pierre
she
again
began
to
laugh
She
evidently
felt
unable
to
look
at
him
without
laughing
but
could
not
resist
looking
at
him
so
to
be
out
of
temptation
she
slipped
quietly
behind
one
of
the
columns
In
the
midst
of
the
service
the
voices
of
the
priests
suddenly
ceased
they
whispered
to
one
another
and
the
old
servant
who
was
holding
the
count
s
hand
got
up
and
said
something
to
the
ladies
Anna
Mikhaylovna
stepped
forward
and
stooping
over
the
dying
man
beckoned
to
Lorrain
from
behind
her
back
The
French
doctor
held
no
taper
he
was
leaning
against
one
of
the
columns
in
a
respectful
attitude
implying
that
he
a
foreigner
in
spite
of
all
differences
of
faith
understood
the
full
importance
of
the
rite
now
being
performed
and
even
approved
of
it
He
now
approached
the
sick
man
with
the
noiseless
step
of
one
in
full
vigor
of
life
with
his
delicate
white
fingers
raised
from
the
green
quilt
the
hand
that
was
free
and
turning
sideways
felt
the
pulse
and
reflected
a
moment
The
sick
man
was
given
something
to
drink
there
was
a
stir
around
him
then
the
people
resumed
their
places
and
the
service
continued
During
this
interval
Pierre
noticed
that
Prince
Vasili
left
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
leaning
and
with
an
air
which
intimated
that
he
knew
what
he
was
about
and
if
others
did
not
understand
him
it
was
so
much
the
worse
for
them
did
not
go
up
to
the
dying
man
but
passed
by
him
joined
the
eldest
princess
and
moved
with
her
to
the
side
of
the
room
where
stood
the
high
bedstead
with
its
silken
hangings
On
leaving
the
bed
both
Prince
Vasili
and
the
princess
passed
out
by
a
back
door
but
returned
to
their
places
one
after
the
other
before
the
service
was
concluded
Pierre
paid
no
more
attention
to
this
occurrence
than
to
the
rest
of
what
went
on
having
made
up
his
mind
once
for
all
that
what
he
saw
happening
around
him
that
evening
was
in
some
way
essential
The
chanting
of
the
service
ceased
and
the
voice
of
the
priest
was
heard
respectfully
congratulating
the
dying
man
on
having
received
the
sacrament
The
dying
man
lay
as
lifeless
and
immovable
as
before
Around
him
everyone
began
to
stir
steps
were
audible
and
whispers
among
which
Anna
Mikhaylovna
s
was
the
most
distinct
Pierre
heard
her
say
Certainly
he
must
be
moved
onto
the
bed
here
it
will
be
impossible
The
sick
man
was
so
surrounded
by
doctors
princesses
and
servants
that
Pierre
could
no
longer
see
the
reddish
yellow
face
with
its
gray
mane
which
though
he
saw
other
faces
as
well
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
for
a
single
moment
during
the
whole
service
He
judged
by
the
cautious
movements
of
those
who
crowded
round
the
invalid
chair
that
they
had
lifted
the
dying
man
and
were
moving
him
Catch
hold
of
my
arm
or
you
ll
drop
him
he
heard
one
of
the
servants
say
in
a
frightened
whisper
Catch
hold
from
underneath
Here
exclaimed
different
voices
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
bearers
and
the
shuffling
of
their
feet
grew
more
hurried
as
if
the
weight
they
were
carrying
were
too
much
for
them
As
the
bearers
among
whom
was
Anna
Mikhaylovna
passed
the
young
man
he
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
between
their
heads
and
backs
of
the
dying
man
s
high
stout
uncovered
chest
and
powerful
shoulders
raised
by
those
who
were
holding
him
under
the
armpits
and
of
his
gray
curly
leonine
head
This
head
with
its
remarkably
broad
brow
and
cheekbones
its
handsome
sensual
mouth
and
its
cold
majestic
expression
was
not
disfigured
by
the
approach
of
death
It
was
the
same
as
Pierre
remembered
it
three
months
before
when
the
count
had
sent
him
to
Petersburg
But
now
this
head
was
swaying
helplessly
with
the
uneven
movements
of
the
bearers
and
the
cold
listless
gaze
fixed
itself
upon
nothing
After
a
few
minutes
bustle
beside
the
high
bedstead
those
who
had
carried
the
sick
man
dispersed
Anna
Mikhaylovna
touched
Pierre
s
hand
and
said
Come
Pierre
went
with
her
to
the
bed
on
which
the
sick
man
had
been
laid
in
a
stately
pose
in
keeping
with
the
ceremony
just
completed
He
lay
with
his
head
propped
high
on
the
pillows
His
hands
were
symmetrically
placed
on
the
green
silk
quilt
the
palms
downward
When
Pierre
came
up
the
count
was
gazing
straight
at
him
but
with
a
look
the
significance
of
which
could
not
be
understood
by
mortal
man
Either
this
look
meant
nothing
but
that
as
long
as
one
has
eyes
they
must
look
somewhere
or
it
meant
too
much
Pierre
hesitated
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
glanced
inquiringly
at
his
guide
Anna
Mikhaylovna
made
a
hurried
sign
with
her
eyes
glancing
at
the
sick
man
s
hand
and
moving
her
lips
as
if
to
send
it
a
kiss
Pierre
carefully
stretching
his
neck
so
as
not
to
touch
the
quilt
followed
her
suggestion
and
pressed
his
lips
to
the
large
boned
fleshy
hand
Neither
the
hand
nor
a
single
muscle
of
the
count
s
face
stirred
Once
more
Pierre
looked
questioningly
at
Anna
Mikhaylovna
to
see
what
he
was
to
do
next
Anna
Mikhaylovna
with
her
eyes
indicated
a
chair
that
stood
beside
the
bed
Pierre
obediently
sat
down
his
eyes
asking
if
he
were
doing
right
Anna
Mikhaylovna
nodded
approvingly
Again
Pierre
fell
into
the
naively
symmetrical
pose
of
an
Egyptian
statue
evidently
distressed
that
his
stout
and
clumsy
body
took
up
so
much
room
and
doing
his
utmost
to
look
as
small
as
possible
He
looked
at
the
count
who
still
gazed
at
the
spot
where
Pierre
s
face
had
been
before
he
sat
down
Anna
Mikhaylovna
indicated
by
her
attitude
her
consciousness
of
the
pathetic
importance
of
these
last
moments
of
meeting
between
the
father
and
son
This
lasted
about
two
minutes
which
to
Pierre
seemed
an
hour
Suddenly
the
broad
muscles
and
lines
of
the
count
s
face
began
to
twitch
The
twitching
increased
the
handsome
mouth
was
drawn
to
one
side
only
now
did
Pierre
realize
how
near
death
his
father
was
and
from
that
distorted
mouth
issued
an
indistinct
hoarse
sound
Anna
Mikhaylovna
looked
attentively
at
the
sick
man
s
eyes
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
she
pointed
first
to
Pierre
then
to
some
drink
then
named
Prince
Vasili
in
an
inquiring
whisper
then
pointed
to
the
quilt
The
eyes
and
face
of
the
sick
man
showed
impatience
He
made
an
effort
to
look
at
the
servant
who
stood
constantly
at
the
head
of
the
bed
Wants
to
turn
on
the
other
side
whispered
the
servant
and
got
up
to
turn
the
count
s
heavy
body
toward
the
wall
Pierre
rose
to
help
him
While
the
count
was
being
turned
over
one
of
his
arms
fell
back
helplessly
and
he
made
a
fruitless
effort
to
pull
it
forward
Whether
he
noticed
the
look
of
terror
with
which
Pierre
regarded
that
lifeless
arm
or
whether
some
other
thought
flitted
across
his
dying
brain
at
any
rate
he
glanced
at
the
refractory
arm
at
Pierre
s
terror
stricken
face
and
again
at
the
arm
and
on
his
face
a
feeble
piteous
smile
appeared
quite
out
of
keeping
with
his
features
that
seemed
to
deride
his
own
helplessness
At
sight
of
this
smile
Pierre
felt
an
unexpected
quivering
in
his
breast
and
a
tickling
in
his
nose
and
tears
dimmed
his
eyes
The
sick
man
was
turned
on
to
his
side
with
his
face
to
the
wall
He
sighed
He
is
dozing
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
observing
that
one
of
the
princesses
was
coming
to
take
her
turn
at
watching
Let
us
go
Pierre
went
out
There
was
now
no
one
in
the
reception
room
except
Prince
Vasili
and
the
eldest
princess
who
were
sitting
under
the
portrait
of
Catherine
the
Great
and
talking
eagerly
As
soon
as
they
saw
Pierre
and
his
companion
they
became
silent
and
Pierre
thought
he
saw
the
princess
hide
something
as
she
whispered
I
can
t
bear
the
sight
of
that
woman
Catiche
has
had
tea
served
in
the
small
drawing
room
said
Prince
Vasili
to
Anna
Mikhaylovna
Go
and
take
something
my
poor
Anna
Mikhaylovna
or
you
will
not
hold
out
To
Pierre
he
said
nothing
merely
giving
his
arm
a
sympathetic
squeeze
below
the
shoulder
Pierre
went
with
Anna
Mikhaylovna
into
the
small
drawing
room
There
is
nothing
so
refreshing
after
a
sleepless
night
as
a
cup
of
this
delicious
Russian
tea
Lorrain
was
saying
with
an
air
of
restrained
animation
as
he
stood
sipping
tea
from
a
delicate
Chinese
handleless
cup
before
a
table
on
which
tea
and
a
cold
supper
were
laid
in
the
small
circular
room
Around
the
table
all
who
were
at
Count
Bezukhov
s
house
that
night
had
gathered
to
fortify
themselves
Pierre
well
remembered
this
small
circular
drawing
room
with
its
mirrors
and
little
tables
During
balls
given
at
the
house
Pierre
who
did
not
know
how
to
dance
had
liked
sitting
in
this
room
to
watch
the
ladies
who
as
they
passed
through
in
their
ball
dresses
with
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
shoulders
looked
at
themselves
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
mirrors
which
repeated
their
reflections
several
times
Now
this
same
room
was
dimly
lighted
by
two
candles
On
one
small
table
tea
things
and
supper
dishes
stood
in
disorder
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
motley
throng
of
people
sat
there
not
merrymaking
but
somberly
whispering
and
betraying
by
every
word
and
movement
that
they
none
of
them
forgot
what
was
happening
and
what
was
about
to
happen
in
the
bedroom
Pierre
did
not
eat
anything
though
he
would
very
much
have
liked
to
He
looked
inquiringly
at
his
monitress
and
saw
that
she
was
again
going
on
tiptoe
to
the
reception
room
where
they
had
left
Prince
Vasili
and
the
eldest
princess
Pierre
concluded
that
this
also
was
essential
and
after
a
short
interval
followed
her
Anna
Mikhaylovna
was
standing
beside
the
princess
and
they
were
both
speaking
in
excited
whispers
Permit
me
Princess
to
know
what
is
necessary
and
what
is
not
necessary
said
the
younger
of
the
two
speakers
evidently
in
the
same
state
of
excitement
as
when
she
had
slammed
the
door
of
her
room
But
my
dear
princess
answered
Anna
Mikhaylovna
blandly
but
impressively
blocking
the
way
to
the
bedroom
and
preventing
the
other
from
passing
won
t
this
be
too
much
for
poor
Uncle
at
a
moment
when
he
needs
repose
Worldly
conversation
at
a
moment
when
his
soul
is
already
prepared
Prince
Vasili
was
seated
in
an
easy
chair
in
his
familiar
attitude
with
one
leg
crossed
high
above
the
other
His
cheeks
which
were
so
flabby
that
they
looked
heavier
below
were
twitching
violently
but
he
wore
the
air
of
a
man
little
concerned
in
what
the
two
ladies
were
saying
Come
my
dear
Anna
Mikhaylovna
let
Catiche
do
as
she
pleases
You
know
how
fond
the
count
is
of
her
I
don
t
even
know
what
is
in
this
paper
said
the
younger
of
the
two
ladies
addressing
Prince
Vasili
and
pointing
to
an
inlaid
portfolio
she
held
in
her
hand
All
I
know
is
that
his
real
will
is
in
his
writing
table
and
this
is
a
paper
he
has
forgotten
She
tried
to
pass
Anna
Mikhaylovna
but
the
latter
sprang
so
as
to
bar
her
path
I
know
my
dear
kind
princess
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
seizing
the
portfolio
so
firmly
that
it
was
plain
she
would
not
let
go
easily
Dear
princess
I
beg
and
implore
you
have
some
pity
on
him
Je
vous
en
conjure
The
princess
did
not
reply
Their
efforts
in
the
struggle
for
the
portfolio
were
the
only
sounds
audible
but
it
was
evident
that
if
the
princess
did
speak
her
words
would
not
be
flattering
to
Anna
Mikhaylovna
Though
the
latter
held
on
tenaciously
her
voice
lost
none
of
its
honeyed
firmness
and
softness
Pierre
my
dear
come
here
I
think
he
will
not
be
out
of
place
in
a
family
consultation
is
it
not
so
Prince
Why
don
t
you
speak
cousin
suddenly
shrieked
the
princess
so
loud
that
those
in
the
drawing
room
heard
her
and
were
startled
Why
do
you
remain
silent
when
heaven
knows
who
permits
herself
to
interfere
making
a
scene
on
the
very
threshold
of
a
dying
man
s
room
Intriguer
she
hissed
viciously
and
tugged
with
all
her
might
at
the
portfolio
But
Anna
Mikhaylovna
went
forward
a
step
or
two
to
keep
her
hold
on
the
portfolio
and
changed
her
grip
Prince
Vasili
rose
Oh
said
he
with
reproach
and
surprise
this
is
absurd
Come
let
go
I
tell
you
The
princess
let
go
And
you
too
But
Anna
Mikhaylovna
did
not
obey
him
Let
go
I
tell
you
I
will
take
the
responsibility
I
myself
will
go
and
ask
him
I
does
that
satisfy
you
But
Prince
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
after
such
a
solemn
sacrament
allow
him
a
moment
s
peace
Here
Pierre
tell
them
your
opinion
said
she
turning
to
the
young
man
who
having
come
quite
close
was
gazing
with
astonishment
at
the
angry
face
of
the
princess
which
had
lost
all
dignity
and
at
the
twitching
cheeks
of
Prince
Vasili
Remember
that
you
will
answer
for
the
consequences
said
Prince
Vasili
severely
You
don
t
know
what
you
are
doing
Vile
woman
shouted
the
princess
darting
unexpectedly
at
Anna
Mikhaylovna
and
snatching
the
portfolio
from
her
Prince
Vasili
bent
his
head
and
spread
out
his
hands
At
this
moment
that
terrible
door
which
Pierre
had
watched
so
long
and
which
had
always
opened
so
quietly
burst
noisily
open
and
banged
against
the
wall
and
the
second
of
the
three
sisters
rushed
out
wringing
her
hands
What
are
you
doing
she
cried
vehemently
He
is
dying
and
you
leave
me
alone
with
him
Her
sister
dropped
the
portfolio
Anna
Mikhaylovna
stooping
quickly
caught
up
the
object
of
contention
and
ran
into
the
bedroom
The
eldest
princess
and
Prince
Vasili
recovering
themselves
followed
her
A
few
minutes
later
the
eldest
sister
came
out
with
a
pale
hard
face
again
biting
her
underlip
At
sight
of
Pierre
her
expression
showed
an
irrepressible
hatred
Yes
now
you
may
be
glad
said
she
this
is
what
you
have
been
waiting
for
And
bursting
into
tears
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
rushed
from
the
room
Prince
Vasili
came
next
He
staggered
to
the
sofa
on
which
Pierre
was
sitting
and
dropped
onto
it
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
Pierre
noticed
that
he
was
pale
and
that
his
jaw
quivered
and
shook
as
if
in
an
ague
Ah
my
friend
said
he
taking
Pierre
by
the
elbow
and
there
was
in
his
voice
a
sincerity
and
weakness
Pierre
had
never
observed
in
it
before
How
often
we
sin
how
much
we
deceive
and
all
for
what
I
am
near
sixty
dear
friend
I
too
All
will
end
in
death
all
Death
is
awful
and
he
burst
into
tears
Anna
Mikhaylovna
came
out
last
She
approached
Pierre
with
slow
quiet
steps
Pierre
she
said
Pierre
gave
her
an
inquiring
look
She
kissed
the
young
man
on
his
forehead
wetting
him
with
her
tears
Then
after
a
pause
she
said
He
is
no
more
Pierre
looked
at
her
over
his
spectacles
Come
I
will
go
with
you
Try
to
weep
nothing
gives
such
relief
as
tears
She
led
him
into
the
dark
drawing
room
and
Pierre
was
glad
no
one
could
see
his
face
Anna
Mikhaylovna
left
him
and
when
she
returned
he
was
fast
asleep
with
his
head
on
his
arm
In
the
morning
Anna
Mikhaylovna
said
to
Pierre
Yes
my
dear
this
is
a
great
loss
for
us
all
not
to
speak
of
you
But
God
will
support
you
you
are
young
and
are
now
I
hope
in
command
of
an
immense
fortune
The
will
has
not
yet
been
opened
I
know
you
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
this
will
not
turn
your
head
but
it
imposes
duties
on
you
and
you
must
be
a
man
Pierre
was
silent
Perhaps
later
on
I
may
tell
you
my
dear
boy
that
if
I
had
not
been
there
God
only
knows
what
would
have
happened
You
know
Uncle
promised
me
only
the
day
before
yesterday
not
to
forget
Boris
But
he
had
no
time
I
hope
my
dear
friend
you
will
carry
out
your
father
s
wish
Pierre
understood
nothing
of
all
this
and
coloring
shyly
looked
in
silence
at
Princess
Anna
Mikhaylovna
After
her
talk
with
Pierre
Anna
Mikhaylovna
returned
to
the
Rostovs
and
went
to
bed
On
waking
in
the
morning
she
told
the
Rostovs
and
all
her
acquaintances
the
details
of
Count
Bezukhov
s
death
She
said
the
count
had
died
as
she
would
herself
wish
to
die
that
his
end
was
not
only
touching
but
edifying
As
to
the
last
meeting
between
father
and
son
it
was
so
touching
that
she
could
not
think
of
it
without
tears
and
did
not
know
which
had
behaved
better
during
those
awful
moments
the
father
who
so
remembered
everything
and
everybody
at
last
and
had
spoken
such
pathetic
words
to
the
son
or
Pierre
whom
it
had
been
pitiful
to
see
so
stricken
was
he
with
grief
though
he
tried
hard
to
hide
it
in
order
not
to
sadden
his
dying
father
It
is
painful
but
it
does
one
good
It
uplifts
the
soul
to
see
such
men
as
the
old
count
and
his
worthy
son
said
she
Of
the
behavior
of
the
eldest
princess
and
Prince
Vasili
she
spoke
disapprovingly
but
in
whispers
and
as
a
great
secret
At
Bald
Hills
Prince
Nicholas
Andreevich
Bolkonski
s
estate
the
arrival
of
young
Prince
Andrew
and
his
wife
was
daily
expected
but
this
expectation
did
not
upset
the
regular
routine
of
life
in
the
old
prince
s
household
General
in
Chief
Prince
Nicholas
Andreevich
nicknamed
in
society
the
King
of
Prussia
ever
since
the
Emperor
Paul
had
exiled
him
to
his
country
estate
had
lived
there
continuously
with
his
daughter
Princess
Mary
and
her
companion
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
Though
in
the
new
reign
he
was
free
to
return
to
the
capitals
he
still
continued
to
live
in
the
country
remarking
that
anyone
who
wanted
to
see
him
could
come
the
hundred
miles
from
Moscow
to
Bald
Hills
while
he
himself
needed
no
one
and
nothing
He
used
to
say
that
there
are
only
two
sources
of
human
vice
idleness
and
superstition
and
only
two
virtues
activity
and
intelligence
He
himself
undertook
his
daughter
s
education
and
to
develop
these
two
cardinal
virtues
in
her
gave
her
lessons
in
algebra
and
geometry
till
she
was
twenty
and
arranged
her
life
so
that
her
whole
time
was
occupied
He
was
himself
always
occupied
writing
his
memoirs
solving
problems
in
higher
mathematics
turning
snuffboxes
on
a
lathe
working
in
the
garden
or
superintending
the
building
that
was
always
going
on
at
his
estate
As
regularity
is
a
prime
condition
facilitating
activity
regularity
in
his
household
was
carried
to
the
highest
point
of
exactitude
He
always
came
to
table
under
precisely
the
same
conditions
and
not
only
at
the
same
hour
but
at
the
same
minute
With
those
about
him
from
his
daughter
to
his
serfs
the
prince
was
sharp
and
invariably
exacting
so
that
without
being
a
hardhearted
man
he
inspired
such
fear
and
respect
as
few
hardhearted
men
would
have
aroused
Although
he
was
in
retirement
and
had
now
no
influence
in
political
affairs
every
high
official
appointed
to
the
province
in
which
the
prince
s
estate
lay
considered
it
his
duty
to
visit
him
and
waited
in
the
lofty
antechamber
just
as
the
architect
gardener
or
Princess
Mary
did
till
the
prince
appeared
punctually
to
the
appointed
hour
Everyone
sitting
in
this
antechamber
experienced
the
same
feeling
of
respect
and
even
fear
when
the
enormously
high
study
door
opened
and
showed
the
figure
of
a
rather
small
old
man
with
powdered
wig
small
withered
hands
and
bushy
gray
eyebrows
which
when
he
frowned
sometimes
hid
the
gleam
of
his
shrewd
youthfully
glittering
eyes
On
the
morning
of
the
day
that
the
young
couple
were
to
arrive
Princess
Mary
entered
the
antechamber
as
usual
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
morning
greeting
crossing
herself
with
trepidation
and
repeating
a
silent
prayer
Every
morning
she
came
in
like
that
and
every
morning
prayed
that
the
daily
interview
might
pass
off
well
An
old
powdered
manservant
who
was
sitting
in
the
antechamber
rose
quietly
and
said
in
a
whisper
Please
walk
in
Through
the
door
came
the
regular
hum
of
a
lathe
The
princess
timidly
opened
the
door
which
moved
noiselessly
and
easily
She
paused
at
the
entrance
The
prince
was
working
at
the
lathe
and
after
glancing
round
continued
his
work
The
enormous
study
was
full
of
things
evidently
in
constant
use
The
large
table
covered
with
books
and
plans
the
tall
glass
fronted
bookcases
with
keys
in
the
locks
the
high
desk
for
writing
while
standing
up
on
which
lay
an
open
exercise
book
and
the
lathe
with
tools
laid
ready
to
hand
and
shavings
scattered
around
all
indicated
continuous
varied
and
orderly
activity
The
motion
of
the
small
foot
shod
in
a
Tartar
boot
embroidered
with
silver
and
the
firm
pressure
of
the
lean
sinewy
hand
showed
that
the
prince
still
possessed
the
tenacious
endurance
and
vigor
of
hardy
old
age
After
a
few
more
turns
of
the
lathe
he
removed
his
foot
from
the
pedal
wiped
his
chisel
dropped
it
into
a
leather
pouch
attached
to
the
lathe
and
approaching
the
table
summoned
his
daughter
He
never
gave
his
children
a
blessing
so
he
simply
held
out
his
bristly
cheek
as
yet
unshaven
and
regarding
her
tenderly
and
attentively
said
severely
Quite
well
All
right
then
sit
down
He
took
the
exercise
book
containing
lessons
in
geometry
written
by
himself
and
drew
up
a
chair
with
his
foot
For
tomorrow
said
he
quickly
finding
the
page
and
making
a
scratch
from
one
paragraph
to
another
with
his
hard
nail
The
princess
bent
over
the
exercise
book
on
the
table
Wait
a
bit
here
s
a
letter
for
you
said
the
old
man
suddenly
taking
a
letter
addressed
in
a
woman
s
hand
from
a
bag
hanging
above
the
table
onto
which
he
threw
it
At
the
sight
of
the
letter
red
patches
showed
themselves
on
the
princess
face
She
took
it
quickly
and
bent
her
head
over
it
From
Heloise
asked
the
prince
with
a
cold
smile
that
showed
his
still
sound
yellowish
teeth
Yes
it
s
from
Julie
replied
the
princess
with
a
timid
glance
and
a
timid
smile
I
ll
let
two
more
letters
pass
but
the
third
I
ll
read
said
the
prince
sternly
I
m
afraid
you
write
much
nonsense
I
ll
read
the
third
Read
this
if
you
like
Father
said
the
princess
blushing
still
more
and
holding
out
the
letter
The
third
I
said
the
third
cried
the
prince
abruptly
pushing
the
letter
away
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
table
he
drew
toward
him
the
exercise
book
containing
geometrical
figures
Well
madam
he
began
stooping
over
the
book
close
to
his
daughter
and
placing
an
arm
on
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
she
sat
so
that
she
felt
herself
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
acrid
scent
of
old
age
and
tobacco
which
she
had
known
so
long
Now
madam
these
triangles
are
equal
please
note
that
the
angle
ABC
The
princess
looked
in
a
scared
way
at
her
father
s
eyes
glittering
close
to
her
the
red
patches
on
her
face
came
and
went
and
it
was
plain
that
she
understood
nothing
and
was
so
frightened
that
her
fear
would
prevent
her
understanding
any
of
her
father
s
further
explanations
however
clear
they
might
be
Whether
it
was
the
teacher
s
fault
or
the
pupil
s
this
same
thing
happened
every
day
the
princess
eyes
grew
dim
she
could
not
see
and
could
not
hear
anything
but
was
only
conscious
of
her
stern
father
s
withered
face
close
to
her
of
his
breath
and
the
smell
of
him
and
could
think
only
of
how
to
get
away
quickly
to
her
own
room
to
make
out
the
problem
in
peace
The
old
man
was
beside
himself
moved
the
chair
on
which
he
was
sitting
noisily
backward
and
forward
made
efforts
to
control
himself
and
not
become
vehement
but
almost
always
did
become
vehement
scolded
and
sometimes
flung
the
exercise
book
away
The
princess
gave
a
wrong
answer
Well
now
isn
t
she
a
fool
shouted
the
prince
pushing
the
book
aside
and
turning
sharply
away
but
rising
immediately
he
paced
up
and
down
lightly
touched
his
daughter
s
hair
and
sat
down
again
He
drew
up
his
chair
and
continued
to
explain
This
won
t
do
Princess
it
won
t
do
said
he
when
Princess
Mary
having
taken
and
closed
the
exercise
book
with
the
next
day
s
lesson
was
about
to
leave
Mathematics
are
most
important
madam
I
don
t
want
to
have
you
like
our
silly
ladies
Get
used
to
it
and
you
ll
like
it
and
he
patted
her
cheek
It
will
drive
all
the
nonsense
out
of
your
head
She
turned
to
go
but
he
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
and
took
an
uncut
book
from
the
high
desk
Here
is
some
sort
of
Key
to
the
Mysteries
that
your
Heloise
has
sent
you
Religious
I
don
t
interfere
with
anyone
s
belief
I
have
looked
at
it
Take
it
Well
now
go
Go
He
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
and
himself
closed
the
door
after
her
Princess
Mary
went
back
to
her
room
with
the
sad
scared
expression
that
rarely
left
her
and
which
made
her
plain
sickly
face
yet
plainer
She
sat
down
at
her
writing
table
on
which
stood
miniature
portraits
and
which
was
littered
with
books
and
papers
The
princess
was
as
untidy
as
her
father
was
tidy
She
put
down
the
geometry
book
and
eagerly
broke
the
seal
of
her
letter
It
was
from
her
most
intimate
friend
from
childhood
that
same
Julie
Karagina
who
had
been
at
the
Rostovs
name
day
party
Julie
wrote
in
French
Dear
and
precious
Friend
How
terrible
and
frightful
a
thing
is
separation
Though
I
tell
myself
that
half
my
life
and
half
my
happiness
are
wrapped
up
in
you
and
that
in
spite
of
the
distance
separating
us
our
hearts
are
united
by
indissoluble
bonds
my
heart
rebels
against
fate
and
in
spite
of
the
pleasures
and
distractions
around
me
I
cannot
overcome
a
certain
secret
sorrow
that
has
been
in
my
heart
ever
since
we
parted
Why
are
we
not
together
as
we
were
last
summer
in
your
big
study
on
the
blue
sofa
the
confidential
sofa
Why
cannot
I
now
as
three
months
ago
draw
fresh
moral
strength
from
your
look
so
gentle
calm
and
penetrating
a
look
I
loved
so
well
and
seem
to
see
before
me
as
I
write
Having
read
thus
far
Princess
Mary
sighed
and
glanced
into
the
mirror
which
stood
on
her
right
It
reflected
a
weak
ungraceful
figure
and
thin
face
Her
eyes
always
sad
now
looked
with
particular
hopelessness
at
her
reflection
in
the
glass
She
flatters
me
thought
the
princess
turning
away
and
continuing
to
read
But
Julie
did
not
flatter
her
friend
the
princess
eyes
large
deep
and
luminous
it
seemed
as
if
at
times
there
radiated
from
them
shafts
of
warm
light
were
so
beautiful
that
very
often
in
spite
of
the
plainness
of
her
face
they
gave
her
an
attraction
more
powerful
than
that
of
beauty
But
the
princess
never
saw
the
beautiful
expression
of
her
own
eyes
the
look
they
had
when
she
was
not
thinking
of
herself
As
with
everyone
her
face
assumed
a
forced
unnatural
expression
as
soon
as
she
looked
in
a
glass
She
went
on
reading
All
Moscow
talks
of
nothing
but
war
One
of
my
two
brothers
is
already
abroad
the
other
is
with
the
Guards
who
are
starting
on
their
march
to
the
frontier
Our
dear
Emperor
has
left
Petersburg
and
it
is
thought
intends
to
expose
his
precious
person
to
the
chances
of
war
God
grant
that
the
Corsican
monster
who
is
destroying
the
peace
of
Europe
may
be
overthrown
by
the
angel
whom
it
has
pleased
the
Almighty
in
His
goodness
to
give
us
as
sovereign
To
say
nothing
of
my
brothers
this
war
has
deprived
me
of
one
of
the
associations
nearest
my
heart
I
mean
young
Nicholas
Rostov
who
with
his
enthusiasm
could
not
bear
to
remain
inactive
and
has
left
the
university
to
join
the
army
I
will
confess
to
you
dear
Mary
that
in
spite
of
his
extreme
youth
his
departure
for
the
army
was
a
great
grief
to
me
This
young
man
of
whom
I
spoke
to
you
last
summer
is
so
noble
minded
and
full
of
that
real
youthfulness
which
one
seldom
finds
nowadays
among
our
old
men
of
twenty
and
particularly
he
is
so
frank
and
has
so
much
heart
He
is
so
pure
and
poetic
that
my
relations
with
him
transient
as
they
were
have
been
one
of
the
sweetest
comforts
to
my
poor
heart
which
has
already
suffered
so
much
Someday
I
will
tell
you
about
our
parting
and
all
that
was
said
then
That
is
still
too
fresh
Ah
dear
friend
you
are
happy
not
to
know
these
poignant
joys
and
sorrows
You
are
fortunate
for
the
latter
are
generally
the
stronger
I
know
very
well
that
Count
Nicholas
is
too
young
ever
to
be
more
to
me
than
a
friend
but
this
sweet
friendship
this
poetic
and
pure
intimacy
were
what
my
heart
needed
But
enough
of
this
The
chief
news
about
which
all
Moscow
gossips
is
the
death
of
old
Count
Bezukhov
and
his
inheritance
Fancy
The
three
princesses
have
received
very
little
Prince
Vasili
nothing
and
it
is
Monsieur
Pierre
who
has
inherited
all
the
property
and
has
besides
been
recognized
as
legitimate
so
that
he
is
now
Count
Bezukhov
and
possessor
of
the
finest
fortune
in
Russia
It
is
rumored
that
Prince
Vasili
played
a
very
despicable
part
in
this
affair
and
that
he
returned
to
Petersburg
quite
crestfallen
I
confess
I
understand
very
little
about
all
these
matters
of
wills
and
inheritance
but
I
do
know
that
since
this
young
man
whom
we
all
used
to
know
as
plain
Monsieur
Pierre
has
become
Count
Bezukhov
and
the
owner
of
one
of
the
largest
fortunes
in
Russia
I
am
much
amused
to
watch
the
change
in
the
tone
and
manners
of
the
mammas
burdened
by
marriageable
daughters
and
of
the
young
ladies
themselves
toward
him
though
between
you
and
me
he
always
seemed
to
me
a
poor
sort
of
fellow
As
for
the
past
two
years
people
have
amused
themselves
by
finding
husbands
for
me
most
of
whom
I
don
t
even
know
the
matchmaking
chronicles
of
Moscow
now
speak
of
me
as
the
future
Countess
Bezukhova
But
you
will
understand
that
I
have
no
desire
for
the
post
A
propos
of
marriages
do
you
know
that
a
while
ago
that
universal
auntie
Anna
Mikhaylovna
told
me
under
the
seal
of
strict
secrecy
of
a
plan
of
marriage
for
you
It
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
with
Prince
Vasili
s
son
Anatole
whom
they
wish
to
reform
by
marrying
him
to
someone
rich
and
distinguee
and
it
is
on
you
that
his
relations
choice
has
fallen
I
don
t
know
what
you
will
think
of
it
but
I
consider
it
my
duty
to
let
you
know
of
it
He
is
said
to
be
very
handsome
and
a
terrible
scapegrace
That
is
all
I
have
been
able
to
find
out
about
him
But
enough
of
gossip
I
am
at
the
end
of
my
second
sheet
of
paper
and
Mamma
has
sent
for
me
to
go
and
dine
at
the
Apraksins
Read
the
mystical
book
I
am
sending
you
it
has
an
enormous
success
here
Though
there
are
things
in
it
difficult
for
the
feeble
human
mind
to
grasp
it
is
an
admirable
book
which
calms
and
elevates
the
soul
Adieu
Give
my
respects
to
monsieur
your
father
and
my
compliments
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
I
embrace
you
as
I
love
you
JULIE
P
S
Let
me
have
news
of
your
brother
and
his
charming
little
wife
The
princess
pondered
awhile
with
a
thoughtful
smile
and
her
luminous
eyes
lit
up
so
that
her
face
was
entirely
transformed
Then
she
suddenly
rose
and
with
her
heavy
tread
went
up
to
the
table
She
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
her
hand
moved
rapidly
over
it
This
is
the
reply
she
wrote
also
in
French
Dear
and
precious
Friend
Your
letter
of
the
th
has
given
me
great
delight
So
you
still
love
me
my
romantic
Julie
Separation
of
which
you
say
so
much
that
is
bad
does
not
seem
to
have
had
its
usual
effect
on
you
You
complain
of
our
separation
What
then
should
I
say
if
I
dared
complain
I
who
am
deprived
of
all
who
are
dear
to
me
Ah
if
we
had
not
religion
to
console
us
life
would
be
very
sad
Why
do
you
suppose
that
I
should
look
severely
on
your
affection
for
that
young
man
On
such
matters
I
am
only
severe
with
myself
I
understand
such
feelings
in
others
and
if
never
having
felt
them
I
cannot
approve
of
them
neither
do
I
condemn
them
Only
it
seems
to
me
that
Christian
love
love
of
one
s
neighbor
love
of
one
s
enemy
is
worthier
sweeter
and
better
than
the
feelings
which
the
beautiful
eyes
of
a
young
man
can
inspire
in
a
romantic
and
loving
young
girl
like
yourself
The
news
of
Count
Bezukhov
s
death
reached
us
before
your
letter
and
my
father
was
much
affected
by
it
He
says
the
count
was
the
last
representative
but
one
of
the
great
century
and
that
it
is
his
own
turn
now
but
that
he
will
do
all
he
can
to
let
his
turn
come
as
late
as
possible
God
preserve
us
from
that
terrible
misfortune
I
cannot
agree
with
you
about
Pierre
whom
I
knew
as
a
child
He
always
seemed
to
me
to
have
an
excellent
heart
and
that
is
the
quality
I
value
most
in
people
As
to
his
inheritance
and
the
part
played
by
Prince
Vasili
it
is
very
sad
for
both
Ah
my
dear
friend
our
divine
Saviour
s
words
that
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
Kingdom
of
God
are
terribly
true
I
pity
Prince
Vasili
but
am
still
more
sorry
for
Pierre
So
young
and
burdened
with
such
riches
to
what
temptations
he
will
be
exposed
If
I
were
asked
what
I
desire
most
on
earth
it
would
be
to
be
poorer
than
the
poorest
beggar
A
thousand
thanks
dear
friend
for
the
volume
you
have
sent
me
and
which
has
such
success
in
Moscow
Yet
since
you
tell
me
that
among
some
good
things
it
contains
others
which
our
weak
human
understanding
cannot
grasp
it
seems
to
me
rather
useless
to
spend
time
in
reading
what
is
unintelligible
and
can
therefore
bear
no
fruit
I
never
could
understand
the
fondness
some
people
have
for
confusing
their
minds
by
dwelling
on
mystical
books
that
merely
awaken
their
doubts
and
excite
their
imagination
giving
them
a
bent
for
exaggeration
quite
contrary
to
Christian
simplicity
Let
us
rather
read
the
Epistles
and
Gospels
Let
us
not
seek
to
penetrate
what
mysteries
they
contain
for
how
can
we
miserable
sinners
that
we
are
know
the
terrible
and
holy
secrets
of
Providence
while
we
remain
in
this
flesh
which
forms
an
impenetrable
veil
between
us
and
the
Eternal
Let
us
rather
confine
ourselves
to
studying
those
sublime
rules
which
our
divine
Saviour
has
left
for
our
guidance
here
below
Let
us
try
to
conform
to
them
and
follow
them
and
let
us
be
persuaded
that
the
less
we
let
our
feeble
human
minds
roam
the
better
we
shall
please
God
who
rejects
all
knowledge
that
does
not
come
from
Him
and
the
less
we
seek
to
fathom
what
He
has
been
pleased
to
conceal
from
us
the
sooner
will
He
vouchsafe
its
revelation
to
us
through
His
divine
Spirit
My
father
has
not
spoken
to
me
of
a
suitor
but
has
only
told
me
that
he
has
received
a
letter
and
is
expecting
a
visit
from
Prince
Vasili
In
regard
to
this
project
of
marriage
for
me
I
will
tell
you
dear
sweet
friend
that
I
look
on
marriage
as
a
divine
institution
to
which
we
must
conform
However
painful
it
may
be
to
me
should
the
Almighty
lay
the
duties
of
wife
and
mother
upon
me
I
shall
try
to
perform
them
as
faithfully
as
I
can
without
disquieting
myself
by
examining
my
feelings
toward
him
whom
He
may
give
me
for
husband
I
have
had
a
letter
from
my
brother
who
announces
his
speedy
arrival
at
Bald
Hills
with
his
wife
This
pleasure
will
be
but
a
brief
one
however
for
he
will
leave
us
again
to
take
part
in
this
unhappy
war
into
which
we
have
been
drawn
God
knows
how
or
why
Not
only
where
you
are
at
the
heart
of
affairs
and
of
the
world
is
the
talk
all
of
war
even
here
amid
fieldwork
and
the
calm
of
nature
which
townsfolk
consider
characteristic
of
the
country
rumors
of
war
are
heard
and
painfully
felt
My
father
talks
of
nothing
but
marches
and
countermarches
things
of
which
I
understand
nothing
and
the
day
before
yesterday
during
my
daily
walk
through
the
village
I
witnessed
a
heartrending
scene
It
was
a
convoy
of
conscripts
enrolled
from
our
people
and
starting
to
join
the
army
You
should
have
seen
the
state
of
the
mothers
wives
and
children
of
the
men
who
were
going
and
should
have
heard
the
sobs
It
seems
as
though
mankind
has
forgotten
the
laws
of
its
divine
Saviour
Who
preached
love
and
forgiveness
of
injuries
and
that
men
attribute
the
greatest
merit
to
skill
in
killing
one
another
Adieu
dear
and
kind
friend
may
our
divine
Saviour
and
His
most
Holy
Mother
keep
you
in
their
holy
and
all
powerful
care
MARY
Ah
you
are
sending
off
a
letter
Princess
I
have
already
dispatched
mine
I
have
written
to
my
poor
mother
said
the
smiling
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
rapidly
in
her
pleasant
mellow
tones
and
with
guttural
r
s
She
brought
into
Princess
Mary
s
strenuous
mournful
and
gloomy
world
a
quite
different
atmosphere
careless
lighthearted
and
self
satisfied
Princess
I
must
warn
you
she
added
lowering
her
voice
and
evidently
listening
to
herself
with
pleasure
and
speaking
with
exaggerated
grasseyement
the
prince
has
been
scolding
Michael
Ivanovich
He
is
in
a
very
bad
humor
very
morose
Be
prepared
Ah
dear
friend
replied
Princess
Mary
I
have
asked
you
never
to
warn
me
of
the
humor
my
father
is
in
I
do
not
allow
myself
to
judge
him
and
would
not
have
others
do
so
The
princess
glanced
at
her
watch
and
seeing
that
she
was
five
minutes
late
in
starting
her
practice
on
the
clavichord
went
into
the
sitting
room
with
a
look
of
alarm
Between
twelve
and
two
o
clock
as
the
day
was
mapped
out
the
prince
rested
and
the
princess
played
the
clavichord
The
gray
haired
valet
was
sitting
drowsily
listening
to
the
snoring
of
the
prince
who
was
in
his
large
study
From
the
far
side
of
the
house
through
the
closed
doors
came
the
sound
of
difficult
passages
twenty
times
repeated
of
a
sonata
by
Dussek
Just
then
a
closed
carriage
and
another
with
a
hood
drove
up
to
the
porch
Prince
Andrew
got
out
of
the
carriage
helped
his
little
wife
to
alight
and
let
her
pass
into
the
house
before
him
Old
Tikhon
wearing
a
wig
put
his
head
out
of
the
door
of
the
antechamber
reported
in
a
whisper
that
the
prince
was
sleeping
and
hastily
closed
the
door
Tikhon
knew
that
neither
the
son
s
arrival
nor
any
other
unusual
event
must
be
allowed
to
disturb
the
appointed
order
of
the
day
Prince
Andrew
apparently
knew
this
as
well
as
Tikhon
he
looked
at
his
watch
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
his
father
s
habits
had
changed
since
he
was
at
home
last
and
having
assured
himself
that
they
had
not
he
turned
to
his
wife
He
will
get
up
in
twenty
minutes
Let
us
go
across
to
Mary
s
room
he
said
The
little
princess
had
grown
stouter
during
this
time
but
her
eyes
and
her
short
downy
smiling
lip
lifted
when
she
began
to
speak
just
as
merrily
and
prettily
as
ever
Why
this
is
a
palace
she
said
to
her
husband
looking
around
with
the
expression
with
which
people
compliment
their
host
at
a
ball
Let
s
come
quick
quick
And
with
a
glance
round
she
smiled
at
Tikhon
at
her
husband
and
at
the
footman
who
accompanied
them
Is
that
Mary
practicing
Let
s
go
quietly
and
take
her
by
surprise
Prince
Andrew
followed
her
with
a
courteous
but
sad
expression
You
ve
grown
older
Tikhon
he
said
in
passing
to
the
old
man
who
kissed
his
hand
Before
they
reached
the
room
from
which
the
sounds
of
the
clavichord
came
the
pretty
fair
haired
Frenchwoman
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
rushed
out
apparently
beside
herself
with
delight
Ah
what
joy
for
the
princess
exclaimed
she
At
last
I
must
let
her
know
No
no
please
not
You
are
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
said
the
little
princess
kissing
her
I
know
you
already
through
my
sister
in
law
s
friendship
for
you
She
was
not
expecting
us
They
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
sitting
room
from
which
came
the
sound
of
the
oft
repeated
passage
of
the
sonata
Prince
Andrew
stopped
and
made
a
grimace
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
The
little
princess
entered
the
room
The
passage
broke
off
in
the
middle
a
cry
was
heard
then
Princess
Mary
s
heavy
tread
and
the
sound
of
kissing
When
Prince
Andrew
went
in
the
two
princesses
who
had
only
met
once
before
for
a
short
time
at
his
wedding
were
in
each
other
s
arms
warmly
pressing
their
lips
to
whatever
place
they
happened
to
touch
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
stood
near
them
pressing
her
hand
to
her
heart
with
a
beatific
smile
and
obviously
equally
ready
to
cry
or
to
laugh
Prince
Andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
frowned
as
lovers
of
music
do
when
they
hear
a
false
note
The
two
women
let
go
of
one
another
and
then
as
if
afraid
of
being
too
late
seized
each
other
s
hands
kissing
them
and
pulling
them
away
and
again
began
kissing
each
other
on
the
face
and
then
to
Prince
Andrew
s
surprise
both
began
to
cry
and
kissed
again
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
also
began
to
cry
Prince
Andrew
evidently
felt
ill
at
ease
but
to
the
two
women
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
they
should
cry
and
apparently
it
never
entered
their
heads
that
it
could
have
been
otherwise
at
this
meeting
Ah
my
dear
Ah
Mary
they
suddenly
exclaimed
and
then
laughed
I
dreamed
last
night
You
were
not
expecting
us
Ah
Mary
you
have
got
thinner
And
you
have
grown
stouter
I
knew
the
princess
at
once
put
in
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
And
I
had
no
idea
exclaimed
Princess
Mary
Ah
Andrew
I
did
not
see
you
Prince
Andrew
and
his
sister
hand
in
hand
kissed
one
another
and
he
told
her
she
was
still
the
same
crybaby
as
ever
Princess
Mary
had
turned
toward
her
brother
and
through
her
tears
the
loving
warm
gentle
look
of
her
large
luminous
eyes
very
beautiful
at
that
moment
rested
on
Prince
Andrew
s
face
The
little
princess
talked
incessantly
her
short
downy
upper
lip
continually
and
rapidly
touching
her
rosy
nether
lip
when
necessary
and
drawing
up
again
next
moment
when
her
face
broke
into
a
smile
of
glittering
teeth
and
sparkling
eyes
She
told
of
an
accident
they
had
had
on
the
Spasski
Hill
which
might
have
been
serious
for
her
in
her
condition
and
immediately
after
that
informed
them
that
she
had
left
all
her
clothes
in
Petersburg
and
that
heaven
knew
what
she
would
have
to
dress
in
here
and
that
Andrew
had
quite
changed
and
that
Kitty
Odyntsova
had
married
an
old
man
and
that
there
was
a
suitor
for
Mary
a
real
one
but
that
they
would
talk
of
that
later
Princess
Mary
was
still
looking
silently
at
her
brother
and
her
beautiful
eyes
were
full
of
love
and
sadness
It
was
plain
that
she
was
following
a
train
of
thought
independent
of
her
sister
in
law
s
words
In
the
midst
of
a
description
of
the
last
Petersburg
fete
she
addressed
her
brother
So
you
are
really
going
to
the
war
Andrew
she
said
sighing
Lise
sighed
too
Yes
and
even
tomorrow
replied
her
brother
He
is
leaving
me
here
God
knows
why
when
he
might
have
had
promotion
Princess
Mary
did
not
listen
to
the
end
but
continuing
her
train
of
thought
turned
to
her
sister
in
law
with
a
tender
glance
at
her
figure
Is
it
certain
she
said
The
face
of
the
little
princess
changed
She
sighed
and
said
Yes
quite
certain
Ah
it
is
very
dreadful
Her
lip
descended
She
brought
her
face
close
to
her
sister
in
law
s
and
unexpectedly
again
began
to
cry
She
needs
rest
said
Prince
Andrew
with
a
frown
Don
t
you
Lise
Take
her
to
your
room
and
I
ll
go
to
Father
How
is
he
Just
the
same
Yes
just
the
same
Though
I
don
t
know
what
your
opinion
will
be
answered
the
princess
joyfully
And
are
the
hours
the
same
And
the
walks
in
the
avenues
And
the
lathe
asked
Prince
Andrew
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
which
showed
that
in
spite
of
all
his
love
and
respect
for
his
father
he
was
aware
of
his
weaknesses
The
hours
are
the
same
and
the
lathe
and
also
the
mathematics
and
my
geometry
lessons
said
Princess
Mary
gleefully
as
if
her
lessons
in
geometry
were
among
the
greatest
delights
of
her
life
When
the
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
and
the
time
had
come
for
the
old
prince
to
get
up
Tikhon
came
to
call
the
young
prince
to
his
father
The
old
man
made
a
departure
from
his
usual
routine
in
honor
of
his
son
s
arrival
he
gave
orders
to
admit
him
to
his
apartments
while
he
dressed
for
dinner
The
old
prince
always
dressed
in
old
fashioned
style
wearing
an
antique
coat
and
powdered
hair
and
when
Prince
Andrew
entered
his
father
s
dressing
room
not
with
the
contemptuous
look
and
manner
he
wore
in
drawing
rooms
but
with
the
animated
face
with
which
he
talked
to
Pierre
the
old
man
was
sitting
on
a
large
leather
covered
chair
wrapped
in
a
powdering
mantle
entrusting
his
head
to
Tikhon
Ah
here
s
the
warrior
Wants
to
vanquish
Buonaparte
said
the
old
man
shaking
his
powdered
head
as
much
as
the
tail
which
Tikhon
was
holding
fast
to
plait
would
allow
You
at
least
must
tackle
him
properly
or
else
if
he
goes
on
like
this
he
ll
soon
have
us
too
for
his
subjects
How
are
you
And
he
held
out
his
cheek
The
old
man
was
in
a
good
temper
after
his
nap
before
dinner
He
used
to
say
that
a
nap
after
dinner
was
silver
before
dinner
golden
He
cast
happy
sidelong
glances
at
his
son
from
under
his
thick
bushy
eyebrows
Prince
Andrew
went
up
and
kissed
his
father
on
the
spot
indicated
to
him
He
made
no
reply
on
his
father
s
favorite
topic
making
fun
of
the
military
men
of
the
day
and
more
particularly
of
Bonaparte
Yes
Father
I
have
come
to
you
and
brought
my
wife
who
is
pregnant
said
Prince
Andrew
following
every
movement
of
his
father
s
face
with
an
eager
and
respectful
look
How
is
your
health
Only
fools
and
rakes
fall
ill
my
boy
You
know
me
I
am
busy
from
morning
till
night
and
abstemious
so
of
course
I
am
well
Thank
God
said
his
son
smiling
God
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
Well
go
on
he
continued
returning
to
his
hobby
tell
me
how
the
Germans
have
taught
you
to
fight
Bonaparte
by
this
new
science
you
call
strategy
Prince
Andrew
smiled
Give
me
time
to
collect
my
wits
Father
said
he
with
a
smile
that
showed
that
his
father
s
foibles
did
not
prevent
his
son
from
loving
and
honoring
him
Why
I
have
not
yet
had
time
to
settle
down
Nonsense
nonsense
cried
the
old
man
shaking
his
pigtail
to
see
whether
it
was
firmly
plaited
and
grasping
his
by
the
hand
The
house
for
your
wife
is
ready
Princess
Mary
will
take
her
there
and
show
her
over
and
they
ll
talk
nineteen
to
the
dozen
That
s
their
woman
s
way
I
am
glad
to
have
her
Sit
down
and
talk
About
Mikhelson
s
army
I
understand
Tolstoy
s
too
a
simultaneous
expedition
But
what
s
the
southern
army
to
do
Prussia
is
neutral
I
know
that
What
about
Austria
said
he
rising
from
his
chair
and
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
followed
by
Tikhon
who
ran
after
him
handing
him
different
articles
of
clothing
What
of
Sweden
How
will
they
cross
Pomerania
Prince
Andrew
seeing
that
his
father
insisted
began
at
first
reluctantly
but
gradually
with
more
and
more
animation
and
from
habit
changing
unconsciously
from
Russian
to
French
as
he
went
on
to
explain
the
plan
of
operation
for
the
coming
campaign
He
explained
how
an
army
ninety
thousand
strong
was
to
threaten
Prussia
so
as
to
bring
her
out
of
her
neutrality
and
draw
her
into
the
war
how
part
of
that
army
was
to
join
some
Swedish
forces
at
Stralsund
how
two
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
Austrians
with
a
hundred
thousand
Russians
were
to
operate
in
Italy
and
on
the
Rhine
how
fifty
thousand
Russians
and
as
many
English
were
to
land
at
Naples
and
how
a
total
force
of
five
hundred
thousand
men
was
to
attack
the
French
from
different
sides
The
old
prince
did
not
evince
the
least
interest
during
this
explanation
but
as
if
he
were
not
listening
to
it
continued
to
dress
while
walking
about
and
three
times
unexpectedly
interrupted
Once
he
stopped
it
by
shouting
The
white
one
the
white
one
This
meant
that
Tikhon
was
not
handing
him
the
waistcoat
he
wanted
Another
time
he
interrupted
saying
And
will
she
soon
be
confined
and
shaking
his
head
reproachfully
said
That
s
bad
Go
on
go
on
The
third
interruption
came
when
Prince
Andrew
was
finishing
his
description
The
old
man
began
to
sing
in
the
cracked
voice
of
old
age
Malbrook
s
en
va
t
en
guerre
Dieu
sait
quand
reviendra
Marlborough
is
going
to
the
wars
God
knows
when
he
ll
return
His
son
only
smiled
I
don
t
say
it
s
a
plan
I
approve
of
said
the
son
I
am
only
telling
you
what
it
is
Napoleon
has
also
formed
his
plan
by
now
not
worse
than
this
one
Well
you
ve
told
me
nothing
new
and
the
old
man
repeated
meditatively
and
rapidly
Dieu
sait
quand
reviendra
Go
to
the
dining
room
At
the
appointed
hour
the
prince
powdered
and
shaven
entered
the
dining
room
where
his
daughter
in
law
Princess
Mary
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
were
already
awaiting
him
together
with
his
architect
who
by
a
strange
caprice
of
his
employer
s
was
admitted
to
table
though
the
position
of
that
insignificant
individual
was
such
as
could
certainly
not
have
caused
him
to
expect
that
honor
The
prince
who
generally
kept
very
strictly
to
social
distinctions
and
rarely
admitted
even
important
government
officials
to
his
table
had
unexpectedly
selected
Michael
Ivanovich
who
always
went
into
a
corner
to
blow
his
nose
on
his
checked
handkerchief
to
illustrate
the
theory
that
all
men
are
equals
and
had
more
than
once
impressed
on
his
daughter
that
Michael
Ivanovich
was
not
a
whit
worse
than
you
or
I
At
dinner
the
prince
usually
spoke
to
the
taciturn
Michael
Ivanovich
more
often
than
to
anyone
else
In
the
dining
room
which
like
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
was
exceedingly
lofty
the
members
of
the
household
and
the
footmen
one
behind
each
chair
stood
waiting
for
the
prince
to
enter
The
head
butler
napkin
on
arm
was
scanning
the
setting
of
the
table
making
signs
to
the
footmen
and
anxiously
glancing
from
the
clock
to
the
door
by
which
the
prince
was
to
enter
Prince
Andrew
was
looking
at
a
large
gilt
frame
new
to
him
containing
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
Princes
Bolkonski
opposite
which
hung
another
such
frame
with
a
badly
painted
portrait
evidently
by
the
hand
of
the
artist
belonging
to
the
estate
of
a
ruling
prince
in
a
crown
an
alleged
descendant
of
Rurik
and
ancestor
of
the
Bolkonskis
Prince
Andrew
looking
again
at
that
genealogical
tree
shook
his
head
laughing
as
a
man
laughs
who
looks
at
a
portrait
so
characteristic
of
the
original
as
to
be
amusing
How
thoroughly
like
him
that
is
he
said
to
Princess
Mary
who
had
come
up
to
him
Princess
Mary
looked
at
her
brother
in
surprise
She
did
not
understand
what
he
was
laughing
at
Everything
her
father
did
inspired
her
with
reverence
and
was
beyond
question
Everyone
has
his
Achilles
heel
continued
Prince
Andrew
Fancy
with
his
powerful
mind
indulging
in
such
nonsense
Princess
Mary
could
not
understand
the
boldness
of
her
brother
s
criticism
and
was
about
to
reply
when
the
expected
footsteps
were
heard
coming
from
the
study
The
prince
walked
in
quickly
and
jauntily
as
was
his
wont
as
if
intentionally
contrasting
the
briskness
of
his
manners
with
the
strict
formality
of
his
house
At
that
moment
the
great
clock
struck
two
and
another
with
a
shrill
tone
joined
in
from
the
drawing
room
The
prince
stood
still
his
lively
glittering
eyes
from
under
their
thick
bushy
eyebrows
sternly
scanned
all
present
and
rested
on
the
little
princess
She
felt
as
courtiers
do
when
the
Tsar
enters
the
sensation
of
fear
and
respect
which
the
old
man
inspired
in
all
around
him
He
stroked
her
hair
and
then
patted
her
awkwardly
on
the
back
of
her
neck
I
m
glad
glad
to
see
you
he
said
looking
attentively
into
her
eyes
and
then
quickly
went
to
his
place
and
sat
down
Sit
down
sit
down
Sit
down
Michael
Ianovich
He
indicated
a
place
beside
him
to
his
daughter
in
law
A
footman
moved
the
chair
for
her
Ho
ho
said
the
old
man
casting
his
eyes
on
her
rounded
figure
You
ve
been
in
a
hurry
That
s
bad
He
laughed
in
his
usual
dry
cold
unpleasant
way
with
his
lips
only
and
not
with
his
eyes
You
must
walk
walk
as
much
as
possible
as
much
as
possible
he
said
The
little
princess
did
not
or
did
not
wish
to
hear
his
words
She
was
silent
and
seemed
confused
The
prince
asked
her
about
her
father
and
she
began
to
smile
and
talk
He
asked
about
mutual
acquaintances
and
she
became
still
more
animated
and
chattered
away
giving
him
greetings
from
various
people
and
retelling
the
town
gossip
Countess
Apraksina
poor
thing
has
lost
her
husband
and
she
has
cried
her
eyes
out
she
said
growing
more
and
more
lively
As
she
became
animated
the
prince
looked
at
her
more
and
more
sternly
and
suddenly
as
if
he
had
studied
her
sufficiently
and
had
formed
a
definite
idea
of
her
he
turned
away
and
addressed
Michael
Ivanovich
Well
Michael
Ivanovich
our
Bonaparte
will
be
having
a
bad
time
of
it
Prince
Andrew
he
always
spoke
thus
of
his
son
has
been
telling
me
what
forces
are
being
collected
against
him
While
you
and
I
never
thought
much
of
him
Michael
Ivanovich
did
not
at
all
know
when
you
and
I
had
said
such
things
about
Bonaparte
but
understanding
that
he
was
wanted
as
a
peg
on
which
to
hang
the
prince
s
favorite
topic
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
young
prince
wondering
what
would
follow
He
is
a
great
tactician
said
the
prince
to
his
son
pointing
to
the
architect
And
the
conversation
again
turned
on
the
war
on
Bonaparte
and
the
generals
and
statesmen
of
the
day
The
old
prince
seemed
convinced
not
only
that
all
the
men
of
the
day
were
mere
babies
who
did
not
know
the
A
B
C
of
war
or
of
politics
and
that
Bonaparte
was
an
insignificant
little
Frenchy
successful
only
because
there
were
no
longer
any
Potemkins
or
Suvorovs
left
to
oppose
him
but
he
was
also
convinced
that
there
were
no
political
difficulties
in
Europe
and
no
real
war
but
only
a
sort
of
puppet
show
at
which
the
men
of
the
day
were
playing
pretending
to
do
something
real
Prince
Andrew
gaily
bore
with
his
father
s
ridicule
of
the
new
men
and
drew
him
on
and
listened
to
him
with
evident
pleasure
The
past
always
seems
good
said
he
but
did
not
Suvorov
himself
fall
into
a
trap
Moreau
set
him
and
from
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
escape
Who
told
you
that
Who
cried
the
prince
Suvorov
And
he
jerked
away
his
plate
which
Tikhon
briskly
caught
Suvorov
Consider
Prince
Andrew
Two
Frederick
and
Suvorov
Moreau
Moreau
would
have
been
a
prisoner
if
Suvorov
had
had
a
free
hand
but
he
had
the
Hofs
kriegs
wurst
schnapps
Rath
on
his
hands
It
would
have
puzzled
the
devil
himself
When
you
get
there
you
ll
find
out
what
those
Hofs
kriegs
wurst
Raths
are
Suvorov
couldn
t
manage
them
so
what
chance
has
Michael
Kutuzov
No
my
dear
boy
he
continued
you
and
your
generals
won
t
get
on
against
Buonaparte
you
ll
have
to
call
in
the
French
so
that
birds
of
a
feather
may
fight
together
The
German
Pahlen
has
been
sent
to
New
York
in
America
to
fetch
the
Frenchman
Moreau
he
said
alluding
to
the
invitation
made
that
year
to
Moreau
to
enter
the
Russian
service
Wonderful
Were
the
Potemkins
Suvorovs
and
Orlovs
Germans
No
lad
either
you
fellows
have
all
lost
your
wits
or
I
have
outlived
mine
May
God
help
you
but
we
ll
see
what
will
happen
Buonaparte
has
become
a
great
commander
among
them
Hm
I
don
t
at
all
say
that
all
the
plans
are
good
said
Prince
Andrew
I
am
only
surprised
at
your
opinion
of
Bonaparte
You
may
laugh
as
much
as
you
like
but
all
the
same
Bonaparte
is
a
great
general
Michael
Ivanovich
cried
the
old
prince
to
the
architect
who
busy
with
his
roast
meat
hoped
he
had
been
forgotten
Didn
t
I
tell
you
Buonaparte
was
a
great
tactician
Here
he
says
the
same
thing
To
be
sure
your
excellency
replied
the
architect
The
prince
again
laughed
his
frigid
laugh
Buonaparte
was
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
his
mouth
He
has
got
splendid
soldiers
Besides
he
began
by
attacking
Germans
And
only
idlers
have
failed
to
beat
the
Germans
Since
the
world
began
everybody
has
beaten
the
Germans
They
beat
no
one
except
one
another
He
made
his
reputation
fighting
them
And
the
prince
began
explaining
all
the
blunders
which
according
to
him
Bonaparte
had
made
in
his
campaigns
and
even
in
politics
His
son
made
no
rejoinder
but
it
was
evident
that
whatever
arguments
were
presented
he
was
as
little
able
as
his
father
to
change
his
opinion
He
listened
refraining
from
a
reply
and
involuntarily
wondered
how
this
old
man
living
alone
in
the
country
for
so
many
years
could
know
and
discuss
so
minutely
and
acutely
all
the
recent
European
military
and
political
events
You
think
I
m
an
old
man
and
don
t
understand
the
present
state
of
affairs
concluded
his
father
But
it
troubles
me
I
don
t
sleep
at
night
Come
now
where
has
this
great
commander
of
yours
shown
his
skill
he
concluded
That
would
take
too
long
to
tell
answered
the
son
Well
then
go
to
your
Buonaparte
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
here
s
another
admirer
of
that
powder
monkey
emperor
of
yours
he
exclaimed
in
excellent
French
You
know
Prince
I
am
not
a
Bonapartist
Dieu
sait
quand
reviendra
hummed
the
prince
out
of
tune
and
with
a
laugh
still
more
so
he
quitted
the
table
The
little
princess
during
the
whole
discussion
and
the
rest
of
the
dinner
sat
silent
glancing
with
a
frightened
look
now
at
her
father
in
law
and
now
at
Princess
Mary
When
they
left
the
table
she
took
her
sister
in
law
s
arm
and
drew
her
into
another
room
What
a
clever
man
your
father
is
said
she
perhaps
that
is
why
I
am
afraid
of
him
Oh
he
is
so
kind
answered
Princess
Mary
Prince
Andrew
was
to
leave
next
evening
The
old
prince
not
altering
his
routine
retired
as
usual
after
dinner
The
little
princess
was
in
her
sister
in
law
s
room
Prince
Andrew
in
a
traveling
coat
without
epaulettes
had
been
packing
with
his
valet
in
the
rooms
assigned
to
him
After
inspecting
the
carriage
himself
and
seeing
the
trunks
put
in
he
ordered
the
horses
to
be
harnessed
Only
those
things
he
always
kept
with
him
remained
in
his
room
a
small
box
a
large
canteen
fitted
with
silver
plate
two
Turkish
pistols
and
a
saber
a
present
from
his
father
who
had
brought
it
from
the
siege
of
Ochakov
All
these
traveling
effects
of
Prince
Andrew
s
were
in
very
good
order
new
clean
and
in
cloth
covers
carefully
tied
with
tapes
When
starting
on
a
journey
or
changing
their
mode
of
life
men
capable
of
reflection
are
generally
in
a
serious
frame
of
mind
At
such
moments
one
reviews
the
past
and
plans
for
the
future
Prince
Andrew
s
face
looked
very
thoughtful
and
tender
With
his
hands
behind
him
he
paced
briskly
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
room
looking
straight
before
him
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
Did
he
fear
going
to
the
war
or
was
he
sad
at
leaving
his
wife
perhaps
both
but
evidently
he
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
in
that
mood
for
hearing
footsteps
in
the
passage
he
hurriedly
unclasped
his
hands
stopped
at
a
table
as
if
tying
the
cover
of
the
small
box
and
assumed
his
usual
tranquil
and
impenetrable
expression
It
was
the
heavy
tread
of
Princess
Mary
that
he
heard
I
hear
you
have
given
orders
to
harness
she
cried
panting
she
had
apparently
been
running
and
I
did
so
wish
to
have
another
talk
with
you
alone
God
knows
how
long
we
may
again
be
parted
You
are
not
angry
with
me
for
coming
You
have
changed
so
Andrusha
she
added
as
if
to
explain
such
a
question
She
smiled
as
she
uttered
his
pet
name
Andrusha
It
was
obviously
strange
to
her
to
think
that
this
stern
handsome
man
should
be
Andrusha
the
slender
mischievous
boy
who
had
been
her
playfellow
in
childhood
And
where
is
Lise
he
asked
answering
her
question
only
by
a
smile
She
was
so
tired
that
she
has
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
in
my
room
Oh
Andrew
What
a
treasure
of
a
wife
you
have
said
she
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
facing
her
brother
She
is
quite
a
child
such
a
dear
merry
child
I
have
grown
so
fond
of
her
Prince
Andrew
was
silent
but
the
princess
noticed
the
ironical
and
contemptuous
look
that
showed
itself
on
his
face
One
must
be
indulgent
to
little
weaknesses
who
is
free
from
them
Andrew
Don
t
forget
that
she
has
grown
up
and
been
educated
in
society
and
so
her
position
now
is
not
a
rosy
one
We
should
enter
into
everyone
s
situation
Tout
comprendre
c
est
tout
pardonner
Think
what
it
must
be
for
her
poor
thing
after
what
she
has
been
used
to
to
be
parted
from
her
husband
and
be
left
alone
in
the
country
in
her
condition
It
s
very
hard
To
understand
all
is
to
forgive
all
Prince
Andrew
smiled
as
he
looked
at
his
sister
as
we
smile
at
those
we
think
we
thoroughly
understand
You
live
in
the
country
and
don
t
think
the
life
terrible
he
replied
I
that
s
different
Why
speak
of
me
I
don
t
want
any
other
life
and
can
t
for
I
know
no
other
But
think
Andrew
for
a
young
society
woman
to
be
buried
in
the
country
during
the
best
years
of
her
life
all
alone
for
Papa
is
always
busy
and
I
well
you
know
what
poor
resources
I
have
for
entertaining
a
woman
used
to
the
best
society
There
is
only
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
I
don
t
like
your
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
at
all
said
Prince
Andrew
No
She
is
very
nice
and
kind
and
above
all
she
s
much
to
be
pitied
She
has
no
one
no
one
To
tell
the
truth
I
don
t
need
her
and
she
s
even
in
my
way
You
know
I
always
was
a
savage
and
now
am
even
more
so
I
like
being
alone
Father
likes
her
very
much
She
and
Michael
Ivanovich
are
the
two
people
to
whom
he
is
always
gentle
and
kind
because
he
has
been
a
benefactor
to
them
both
As
Sterne
says
We
don
t
love
people
so
much
for
the
good
they
have
done
us
as
for
the
good
we
have
done
them
Father
took
her
when
she
was
homeless
after
losing
her
own
father
She
is
very
good
natured
and
my
father
likes
her
way
of
reading
She
reads
to
him
in
the
evenings
and
reads
splendidly
To
be
quite
frank
Mary
I
expect
Father
s
character
sometimes
makes
things
trying
for
you
doesn
t
it
Prince
Andrew
asked
suddenly
Princess
Mary
was
first
surprised
and
then
aghast
at
this
question
For
me
For
me
Trying
for
me
said
she
He
always
was
rather
harsh
and
now
I
should
think
he
s
getting
very
trying
said
Prince
Andrew
apparently
speaking
lightly
of
their
father
in
order
to
puzzle
or
test
his
sister
You
are
good
in
every
way
Andrew
but
you
have
a
kind
of
intellectual
pride
said
the
princess
following
the
train
of
her
own
thoughts
rather
than
the
trend
of
the
conversation
and
that
s
a
great
sin
How
can
one
judge
Father
But
even
if
one
might
what
feeling
except
veneration
could
such
a
man
as
my
father
evoke
And
I
am
so
contented
and
happy
with
him
I
only
wish
you
were
all
as
happy
as
I
am
Her
brother
shook
his
head
incredulously
The
only
thing
that
is
hard
for
me
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
Andrew
is
Father
s
way
of
treating
religious
subjects
I
don
t
understand
how
a
man
of
his
immense
intellect
can
fail
to
see
what
is
as
clear
as
day
and
can
go
so
far
astray
That
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
unhappy
But
even
in
this
I
can
see
lately
a
shade
of
improvement
His
satire
has
been
less
bitter
of
late
and
there
was
a
monk
he
received
and
had
a
long
talk
with
Ah
my
dear
I
am
afraid
you
and
your
monk
are
wasting
your
powder
said
Prince
Andrew
banteringly
yet
tenderly
Ah
mon
ami
I
only
pray
and
hope
that
God
will
hear
me
Andrew
she
said
timidly
after
a
moment
s
silence
I
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you
What
is
it
dear
No
promise
that
you
will
not
refuse
It
will
give
you
no
trouble
and
is
nothing
unworthy
of
you
but
it
will
comfort
me
Promise
Andrusha
said
she
putting
her
hand
in
her
reticule
but
not
yet
taking
out
what
she
was
holding
inside
it
as
if
what
she
held
were
the
subject
of
her
request
and
must
not
be
shown
before
the
request
was
granted
She
looked
timidly
at
her
brother
Even
if
it
were
a
great
deal
of
trouble
answered
Prince
Andrew
as
if
guessing
what
it
was
about
Think
what
you
please
I
know
you
are
just
like
Father
Think
as
you
please
but
do
this
for
my
sake
Please
do
Father
s
father
our
grandfather
wore
it
in
all
his
wars
She
still
did
not
take
out
what
she
was
holding
in
her
reticule
So
you
promise
Of
course
What
is
it
Andrew
I
bless
you
with
this
icon
and
you
must
promise
me
you
will
never
take
it
off
Do
you
promise
If
it
does
not
weigh
a
hundredweight
and
won
t
break
my
neck
To
please
you
said
Prince
Andrew
But
immediately
noticing
the
pained
expression
his
joke
had
brought
to
his
sister
s
face
he
repented
and
added
I
am
glad
really
dear
I
am
very
glad
Against
your
will
He
will
save
and
have
mercy
on
you
and
bring
you
to
Himself
for
in
Him
alone
is
truth
and
peace
said
she
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
solemnly
holding
up
in
both
hands
before
her
brother
a
small
oval
antique
dark
faced
icon
of
the
Saviour
in
a
gold
setting
on
a
finely
wrought
silver
chain
She
crossed
herself
kissed
the
icon
and
handed
it
to
Andrew
Please
Andrew
for
my
sake
Rays
of
gentle
light
shone
from
her
large
timid
eyes
Those
eyes
lit
up
the
whole
of
her
thin
sickly
face
and
made
it
beautiful
Her
brother
would
have
taken
the
icon
but
she
stopped
him
Andrew
understood
crossed
himself
and
kissed
the
icon
There
was
a
look
of
tenderness
for
he
was
touched
but
also
a
gleam
of
irony
on
his
face
Thank
you
my
dear
She
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
sat
down
again
on
the
sofa
They
were
silent
for
a
while
As
I
was
saying
to
you
Andrew
be
kind
and
generous
as
you
always
used
to
be
Don
t
judge
Lise
harshly
she
began
She
is
so
sweet
so
good
natured
and
her
position
now
is
a
very
hard
one
I
do
not
think
I
have
complained
of
my
wife
to
you
Masha
or
blamed
her
Why
do
you
say
all
this
to
me
Red
patches
appeared
on
Princess
Mary
s
face
and
she
was
silent
as
if
she
felt
guilty
I
have
said
nothing
to
you
but
you
have
already
been
talked
to
And
I
am
sorry
for
that
he
went
on
The
patches
grew
deeper
on
her
forehead
neck
and
cheeks
She
tried
to
say
something
but
could
not
Her
brother
had
guessed
right
the
little
princess
had
been
crying
after
dinner
and
had
spoken
of
her
forebodings
about
her
confinement
and
how
she
dreaded
it
and
had
complained
of
her
fate
her
father
in
law
and
her
husband
After
crying
she
had
fallen
asleep
Prince
Andrew
felt
sorry
for
his
sister
Know
this
Masha
I
can
t
reproach
have
not
reproached
and
never
shall
reproach
my
wife
with
anything
and
I
cannot
reproach
myself
with
anything
in
regard
to
her
and
that
always
will
be
so
in
whatever
circumstances
I
may
be
placed
But
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
if
you
want
to
know
whether
I
am
happy
No
Is
she
happy
No
But
why
this
is
so
I
don
t
know
As
he
said
this
he
rose
went
to
his
sister
and
stooping
kissed
her
forehead
His
fine
eyes
lit
up
with
a
thoughtful
kindly
and
unaccustomed
brightness
but
he
was
looking
not
at
his
sister
but
over
her
head
toward
the
darkness
of
the
open
doorway
Let
us
go
to
her
I
must
say
good
by
Or
go
and
wake
and
I
ll
come
in
a
moment
Petrushka
he
called
to
his
valet
Come
here
take
these
away
Put
this
on
the
seat
and
this
to
the
right
Princess
Mary
rose
and
moved
to
the
door
then
stopped
and
said
Andrew
if
you
had
faith
you
would
have
turned
to
God
and
asked
Him
to
give
you
the
love
you
do
not
feel
and
your
prayer
would
have
been
answered
Well
may
be
said
Prince
Andrew
Go
Masha
I
ll
come
immediately
On
the
way
to
his
sister
s
room
in
the
passage
which
connected
one
wing
with
the
other
Prince
Andrew
met
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
smiling
sweetly
It
was
the
third
time
that
day
that
with
an
ecstatic
and
artless
smile
she
had
met
him
in
secluded
passages
Oh
I
thought
you
were
in
your
room
she
said
for
some
reason
blushing
and
dropping
her
eyes
Prince
Andrew
looked
sternly
at
her
and
an
expression
of
anger
suddenly
came
over
his
face
He
said
nothing
to
her
but
looked
at
her
forehead
and
hair
without
looking
at
her
eyes
with
such
contempt
that
the
Frenchwoman
blushed
and
went
away
without
a
word
When
he
reached
his
sister
s
room
his
wife
was
already
awake
and
her
merry
voice
hurrying
one
word
after
another
came
through
the
open
door
She
was
speaking
as
usual
in
French
and
as
if
after
long
self
restraint
she
wished
to
make
up
for
lost
time
No
but
imagine
the
old
Countess
Zubova
with
false
curls
and
her
mouth
full
of
false
teeth
as
if
she
were
trying
to
cheat
old
age
Ha
ha
ha
Mary
This
very
sentence
about
Countess
Zubova
and
this
same
laugh
Prince
Andrew
had
already
heard
from
his
wife
in
the
presence
of
others
some
five
times
He
entered
the
room
softly
The
little
princess
plump
and
rosy
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
with
her
work
in
her
hands
talking
incessantly
repeating
Petersburg
reminiscences
and
even
phrases
Prince
Andrew
came
up
stroked
her
hair
and
asked
if
she
felt
rested
after
their
journey
She
answered
him
and
continued
her
chatter
The
coach
with
six
horses
was
waiting
at
the
porch
It
was
an
autumn
night
so
dark
that
the
coachman
could
not
see
the
carriage
pole
Servants
with
lanterns
were
bustling
about
in
the
porch
The
immense
house
was
brilliant
with
lights
shining
through
its
lofty
windows
The
domestic
serfs
were
crowding
in
the
hall
waiting
to
bid
good
by
to
the
young
prince
The
members
of
the
household
were
all
gathered
in
the
reception
hall
Michael
Ivanovich
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
Princess
Mary
and
the
little
princess
Prince
Andrew
had
been
called
to
his
father
s
study
as
the
latter
wished
to
say
good
by
to
him
alone
All
were
waiting
for
them
to
come
out
When
Prince
Andrew
entered
the
study
the
old
man
in
his
old
age
spectacles
and
white
dressing
gown
in
which
he
received
no
one
but
his
son
sat
at
the
table
writing
He
glanced
round
Going
And
he
went
on
writing
I
ve
come
to
say
good
by
Kiss
me
here
and
he
touched
his
cheek
Thanks
thanks
What
do
you
thank
me
for
For
not
dilly
dallying
and
not
hanging
to
a
woman
s
apron
strings
The
Service
before
everything
Thanks
thanks
And
he
went
on
writing
so
that
his
quill
spluttered
and
squeaked
If
you
have
anything
to
say
say
it
These
two
things
can
be
done
together
he
added
About
my
wife
I
am
ashamed
as
it
is
to
leave
her
on
your
hands
Why
talk
nonsense
Say
what
you
want
When
her
confinement
is
due
send
to
Moscow
for
an
accoucheur
Let
him
be
here
The
old
prince
stopped
writing
and
as
if
not
understanding
fixed
his
stern
eyes
on
his
son
I
know
that
no
one
can
help
if
nature
does
not
do
her
work
said
Prince
Andrew
evidently
confused
I
know
that
out
of
a
million
cases
only
one
goes
wrong
but
it
is
her
fancy
and
mine
They
have
been
telling
her
things
She
has
had
a
dream
and
is
frightened
Hm
Hm
muttered
the
old
prince
to
himself
finishing
what
he
was
writing
I
ll
do
it
He
signed
with
a
flourish
and
suddenly
turning
to
his
son
began
to
laugh
It
s
a
bad
business
eh
What
is
bad
Father
The
wife
said
the
old
prince
briefly
and
significantly
I
don
t
understand
said
Prince
Andrew
No
it
can
t
be
helped
lad
said
the
prince
They
re
all
like
that
one
can
t
unmarry
Don
t
be
afraid
I
won
t
tell
anyone
but
you
know
it
yourself
He
seized
his
son
by
the
hand
with
small
bony
fingers
shook
it
looked
straight
into
his
son
s
face
with
keen
eyes
which
seemed
to
see
through
him
and
again
laughed
his
frigid
laugh
The
son
sighed
thus
admitting
that
his
father
had
understood
him
The
old
man
continued
to
fold
and
seal
his
letter
snatching
up
and
throwing
down
the
wax
the
seal
and
the
paper
with
his
accustomed
rapidity
What
s
to
be
done
She
s
pretty
I
will
do
everything
Make
your
mind
easy
said
he
in
abrupt
sentences
while
sealing
his
letter
Andrew
did
not
speak
he
was
both
pleased
and
displeased
that
his
father
understood
him
The
old
man
got
up
and
gave
the
letter
to
his
son
Listen
said
he
don
t
worry
about
your
wife
what
can
be
done
shall
be
Now
listen
Give
this
letter
to
Michael
Ilarionovich
I
have
written
that
he
should
make
use
of
you
in
proper
places
and
not
keep
you
long
as
an
adjutant
a
bad
position
Tell
him
I
remember
and
like
him
Write
and
tell
me
how
he
receives
you
If
he
is
all
right
serve
him
Nicholas
Bolkonski
s
son
need
not
serve
under
anyone
if
he
is
in
disfavor
Now
come
here
Kutuzov
He
spoke
so
rapidly
that
he
did
not
finish
half
his
words
but
his
son
was
accustomed
to
understand
him
He
led
him
to
the
desk
raised
the
lid
drew
out
a
drawer
and
took
out
an
exercise
book
filled
with
his
bold
tall
close
handwriting
I
shall
probably
die
before
you
So
remember
these
are
my
memoirs
hand
them
to
the
Emperor
after
my
death
Now
here
is
a
Lombard
bond
and
a
letter
it
is
a
premium
for
the
man
who
writes
a
history
of
Suvorov
s
wars
Send
it
to
the
Academy
Here
are
some
jottings
for
you
to
read
when
I
am
gone
You
will
find
them
useful
Andrew
did
not
tell
his
father
that
he
would
no
doubt
live
a
long
time
yet
He
felt
that
he
must
not
say
it
I
will
do
it
all
Father
he
said
Well
now
good
by
He
gave
his
son
his
hand
to
kiss
and
embraced
him
Remember
this
Prince
Andrew
if
they
kill
you
it
will
hurt
me
your
old
father
he
paused
unexpectedly
and
then
in
a
querulous
voice
suddenly
shrieked
but
if
I
hear
that
you
have
not
behaved
like
a
son
of
Nicholas
Bolkonski
I
shall
be
ashamed
You
need
not
have
said
that
to
me
Father
said
the
son
with
a
smile
The
old
man
was
silent
I
also
wanted
to
ask
you
continued
Prince
Andrew
if
I
m
killed
and
if
I
have
a
son
do
not
let
him
be
taken
away
from
you
as
I
said
yesterday
let
him
grow
up
with
you
Please
Not
let
the
wife
have
him
said
the
old
man
and
laughed
They
stood
silent
facing
one
another
The
old
man
s
sharp
eyes
were
fixed
straight
on
his
son
s
Something
twitched
in
the
lower
part
of
the
old
prince
s
face
We
ve
said
good
by
Go
he
suddenly
shouted
in
a
loud
angry
voice
opening
his
door
What
is
it
What
asked
both
princesses
when
they
saw
for
a
moment
at
the
door
Prince
Andrew
and
the
figure
of
the
old
man
in
a
white
dressing
gown
spectacled
and
wigless
shouting
in
an
angry
voice
Prince
Andrew
sighed
and
made
no
reply
Well
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
And
this
Well
sounded
coldly
ironic
as
if
he
were
saying
Now
go
through
your
performance
Andrew
already
said
the
little
princess
turning
pale
and
looking
with
dismay
at
her
husband
He
embraced
her
She
screamed
and
fell
unconscious
on
his
shoulder
He
cautiously
released
the
shoulder
she
leaned
on
looked
into
her
face
and
carefully
placed
her
in
an
easy
chair
Adieu
Mary
said
he
gently
to
his
sister
taking
her
by
the
hand
and
kissing
her
and
then
he
left
the
room
with
rapid
steps
The
little
princess
lay
in
the
armchair
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
chafing
her
temples
Princess
Mary
supporting
her
sister
in
law
still
looked
with
her
beautiful
eyes
full
of
tears
at
the
door
through
which
Prince
Andrew
had
gone
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
his
direction
From
the
study
like
pistol
shots
came
the
frequent
sound
of
the
old
man
angrily
blowing
his
nose
Hardly
had
Prince
Andrew
gone
when
the
study
door
opened
quickly
and
the
stern
figure
of
the
old
man
in
the
white
dressing
gown
looked
out
Gone
That
s
all
right
said
he
and
looking
angrily
at
the
unconscious
little
princess
he
shook
his
head
reprovingly
and
slammed
the
door
In
October
a
Russian
army
was
occupying
the
villages
and
towns
of
the
Archduchy
of
Austria
and
yet
other
regiments
freshly
arriving
from
Russia
were
settling
near
the
fortress
of
Braunau
and
burdening
the
inhabitants
on
whom
they
were
quartered
Braunau
was
the
headquarters
of
the
commander
in
chief
Kutuzov
On
October
one
of
the
infantry
regiments
that
had
just
reached
Braunau
had
halted
half
a
mile
from
the
town
waiting
to
be
inspected
by
the
commander
in
chief
Despite
the
un
Russian
appearance
of
the
locality
and
surroundings
fruit
gardens
stone
fences
tiled
roofs
and
hills
in
the
distance
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
inhabitants
who
gazed
with
curiosity
at
the
soldiers
were
not
Russians
the
regiment
had
just
the
appearance
of
any
Russian
regiment
preparing
for
an
inspection
anywhere
in
the
heart
of
Russia
On
the
evening
of
the
last
day
s
march
an
order
had
been
received
that
the
commander
in
chief
would
inspect
the
regiment
on
the
march
Though
the
words
of
the
order
were
not
clear
to
the
regimental
commander
and
the
question
arose
whether
the
troops
were
to
be
in
marching
order
or
not
it
was
decided
at
a
consultation
between
the
battalion
commanders
to
present
the
regiment
in
parade
order
on
the
principle
that
it
is
always
better
to
bow
too
low
than
not
bow
low
enough
So
the
soldiers
after
a
twenty
mile
march
were
kept
mending
and
cleaning
all
night
long
without
closing
their
eyes
while
the
adjutants
and
company
commanders
calculated
and
reckoned
and
by
morning
the
regiment
instead
of
the
straggling
disorderly
crowd
it
had
been
on
its
last
march
the
day
before
presented
a
well
ordered
array
of
two
thousand
men
each
of
whom
knew
his
place
and
his
duty
had
every
button
and
every
strap
in
place
and
shone
with
cleanliness
And
not
only
externally
was
all
in
order
but
had
it
pleased
the
commander
in
chief
to
look
under
the
uniforms
he
would
have
found
on
every
man
a
clean
shirt
and
in
every
knapsack
the
appointed
number
of
articles
awl
soap
and
all
as
the
soldiers
say
There
was
only
one
circumstance
concerning
which
no
one
could
be
at
ease
It
was
the
state
of
the
soldiers
boots
More
than
half
the
men
s
boots
were
in
holes
But
this
defect
was
not
due
to
any
fault
of
the
regimental
commander
for
in
spite
of
repeated
demands
boots
had
not
been
issued
by
the
Austrian
commissariat
and
the
regiment
had
marched
some
seven
hundred
miles
The
commander
of
the
regiment
was
an
elderly
choleric
stout
and
thick
set
general
with
grizzled
eyebrows
and
whiskers
and
wider
from
chest
to
back
than
across
the
shoulders
He
had
on
a
brand
new
uniform
showing
the
creases
where
it
had
been
folded
and
thick
gold
epaulettes
which
seemed
to
stand
rather
than
lie
down
on
his
massive
shoulders
He
had
the
air
of
a
man
happily
performing
one
of
the
most
solemn
duties
of
his
life
He
walked
about
in
front
of
the
line
and
at
every
step
pulled
himself
up
slightly
arching
his
back
It
was
plain
that
the
commander
admired
his
regiment
rejoiced
in
it
and
that
his
whole
mind
was
engrossed
by
it
yet
his
strut
seemed
to
indicate
that
besides
military
matters
social
interests
and
the
fair
sex
occupied
no
small
part
of
his
thoughts
Well
Michael
Mitrich
sir
he
said
addressing
one
of
the
battalion
commanders
who
smilingly
pressed
forward
it
was
plain
that
they
both
felt
happy
We
had
our
hands
full
last
night
However
I
think
the
regiment
is
not
a
bad
one
eh
The
battalion
commander
perceived
the
jovial
irony
and
laughed
It
would
not
be
turned
off
the
field
even
on
the
Tsaritsin
Meadow
What
asked
the
commander
At
that
moment
on
the
road
from
the
town
on
which
signalers
had
been
posted
two
men
appeared
on
horse
back
They
were
an
aide
de
camp
followed
by
a
Cossack
The
aide
de
camp
was
sent
to
confirm
the
order
which
had
not
been
clearly
worded
the
day
before
namely
that
the
commander
in
chief
wished
to
see
the
regiment
just
in
the
state
in
which
it
had
been
on
the
march
in
their
greatcoats
and
packs
and
without
any
preparation
whatever
A
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
from
Vienna
had
come
to
Kutuzov
the
day
before
with
proposals
and
demands
for
him
to
join
up
with
the
army
of
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
and
Mack
and
Kutuzov
not
considering
this
junction
advisable
meant
among
other
arguments
in
support
of
his
view
to
show
the
Austrian
general
the
wretched
state
in
which
the
troops
arrived
from
Russia
With
this
object
he
intended
to
meet
the
regiment
so
the
worse
the
condition
it
was
in
the
better
pleased
the
commander
in
chief
would
be
Though
the
aide
de
camp
did
not
know
these
circumstances
he
nevertheless
delivered
the
definite
order
that
the
men
should
be
in
their
greatcoats
and
in
marching
order
and
that
the
commander
in
chief
would
otherwise
be
dissatisfied
On
hearing
this
the
regimental
commander
hung
his
head
silently
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
arms
with
a
choleric
gesture
A
fine
mess
we
ve
made
of
it
he
remarked
There
now
Didn
t
I
tell
you
Michael
Mitrich
that
if
it
was
said
on
the
march
it
meant
in
greatcoats
said
he
reproachfully
to
the
battalion
commander
Oh
my
God
he
added
stepping
resolutely
forward
Company
commanders
he
shouted
in
a
voice
accustomed
to
command
Sergeants
major
How
soon
will
he
be
here
he
asked
the
aide
de
camp
with
a
respectful
politeness
evidently
relating
to
the
personage
he
was
referring
to
In
an
hour
s
time
I
should
say
Shall
we
have
time
to
change
clothes
I
don
t
know
General
The
regimental
commander
going
up
to
the
line
himself
ordered
the
soldiers
to
change
into
their
greatcoats
The
company
commanders
ran
off
to
their
companies
the
sergeants
major
began
bustling
the
greatcoats
were
not
in
very
good
condition
and
instantly
the
squares
that
had
up
to
then
been
in
regular
order
and
silent
began
to
sway
and
stretch
and
hum
with
voices
On
all
sides
soldiers
were
running
to
and
fro
throwing
up
their
knapsacks
with
a
jerk
of
their
shoulders
and
pulling
the
straps
over
their
heads
unstrapping
their
overcoats
and
drawing
the
sleeves
on
with
upraised
arms
In
half
an
hour
all
was
again
in
order
only
the
squares
had
become
gray
instead
of
black
The
regimental
commander
walked
with
his
jerky
steps
to
the
front
of
the
regiment
and
examined
it
from
a
distance
Whatever
is
this
This
he
shouted
and
stood
still
Commander
of
the
third
company
Commander
of
the
third
company
wanted
by
the
general
commander
to
the
general
third
company
to
the
commander
The
words
passed
along
the
lines
and
an
adjutant
ran
to
look
for
the
missing
officer
When
the
eager
but
misrepeated
words
had
reached
their
destination
in
a
cry
of
The
general
to
the
third
company
the
missing
officer
appeared
from
behind
his
company
and
though
he
was
a
middle
aged
man
and
not
in
the
habit
of
running
trotted
awkwardly
stumbling
on
his
toes
toward
the
general
The
captain
s
face
showed
the
uneasiness
of
a
schoolboy
who
is
told
to
repeat
a
lesson
he
has
not
learned
Spots
appeared
on
his
nose
the
redness
of
which
was
evidently
due
to
intemperance
and
his
mouth
twitched
nervously
The
general
looked
the
captain
up
and
down
as
he
came
up
panting
slackening
his
pace
as
he
approached
You
will
soon
be
dressing
your
men
in
petticoats
What
is
this
shouted
the
regimental
commander
thrusting
forward
his
jaw
and
pointing
at
a
soldier
in
the
ranks
of
the
third
company
in
a
greatcoat
of
bluish
cloth
which
contrasted
with
the
others
What
have
you
been
after
The
commander
in
chief
is
expected
and
you
leave
your
place
Eh
I
ll
teach
you
to
dress
the
men
in
fancy
coats
for
a
parade
Eh
The
commander
of
the
company
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
superior
pressed
two
fingers
more
and
more
rigidly
to
his
cap
as
if
in
this
pressure
lay
his
only
hope
of
salvation
Well
why
don
t
you
speak
Whom
have
you
got
there
dressed
up
as
a
Hungarian
said
the
commander
with
an
austere
gibe
Your
excellency
Well
your
excellency
what
Your
excellency
But
what
about
your
excellency
nobody
knows
Your
excellency
it
s
the
officer
Dolokhov
who
has
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
said
the
captain
softly
Well
Has
he
been
degraded
into
a
field
marshal
or
into
a
soldier
If
a
soldier
he
should
be
dressed
in
regulation
uniform
like
the
others
Your
excellency
you
gave
him
leave
yourself
on
the
march
Gave
him
leave
Leave
That
s
just
like
you
young
men
said
the
regimental
commander
cooling
down
a
little
Leave
indeed
One
says
a
word
to
you
and
you
What
he
added
with
renewed
irritation
I
beg
you
to
dress
your
men
decently
And
the
commander
turning
to
look
at
the
adjutant
directed
his
jerky
steps
down
the
line
He
was
evidently
pleased
at
his
own
display
of
anger
and
walking
up
to
the
regiment
wished
to
find
a
further
excuse
for
wrath
Having
snapped
at
an
officer
for
an
unpolished
badge
at
another
because
his
line
was
not
straight
he
reached
the
third
company
H
o
o
w
are
you
standing
Where
s
your
leg
Your
leg
shouted
the
commander
with
a
tone
of
suffering
in
his
voice
while
there
were
still
five
men
between
him
and
Dolokhov
with
his
bluish
gray
uniform
Dolokhov
slowly
straightened
his
bent
knee
looking
straight
with
his
clear
insolent
eyes
in
the
general
s
face
Why
a
blue
coat
Off
with
it
Sergeant
major
Change
his
coat
the
ras
he
did
not
finish
General
I
must
obey
orders
but
I
am
not
bound
to
endure
Dolokhov
hurriedly
interrupted
No
talking
in
the
ranks
No
talking
no
talking
Not
bound
to
endure
insults
Dolokhov
concluded
in
loud
ringing
tones
The
eyes
of
the
general
and
the
soldier
met
The
general
became
silent
angrily
pulling
down
his
tight
scarf
I
request
you
to
have
the
goodness
to
change
your
coat
he
said
as
he
turned
away
He
s
coming
shouted
the
signaler
at
that
moment
The
regimental
commander
flushing
ran
to
his
horse
seized
the
stirrup
with
trembling
hands
threw
his
body
across
the
saddle
righted
himself
drew
his
saber
and
with
a
happy
and
resolute
countenance
opening
his
mouth
awry
prepared
to
shout
The
regiment
fluttered
like
a
bird
preening
its
plumage
and
became
motionless
Att
ention
shouted
the
regimental
commander
in
a
soul
shaking
voice
which
expressed
joy
for
himself
severity
for
the
regiment
and
welcome
for
the
approaching
chief
Along
the
broad
country
road
edged
on
both
sides
by
trees
came
a
high
light
blue
Viennese
caleche
slightly
creaking
on
its
springs
and
drawn
by
six
horses
at
a
smart
trot
Behind
the
caleche
galloped
the
suite
and
a
convoy
of
Croats
Beside
Kutuzov
sat
an
Austrian
general
in
a
white
uniform
that
looked
strange
among
the
Russian
black
ones
The
caleche
stopped
in
front
of
the
regiment
Kutuzov
and
the
Austrian
general
were
talking
in
low
voices
and
Kutuzov
smiled
slightly
as
treading
heavily
he
stepped
down
from
the
carriage
just
as
if
those
two
thousand
men
breathlessly
gazing
at
him
and
the
regimental
commander
did
not
exist
The
word
of
command
rang
out
and
again
the
regiment
quivered
as
with
a
jingling
sound
it
presented
arms
Then
amidst
a
dead
silence
the
feeble
voice
of
the
commander
in
chief
was
heard
The
regiment
roared
Health
to
your
ex
len
len
lency
and
again
all
became
silent
At
first
Kutuzov
stood
still
while
the
regiment
moved
then
he
and
the
general
in
white
accompanied
by
the
suite
walked
between
the
ranks
From
the
way
the
regimental
commander
saluted
the
commander
in
chief
and
devoured
him
with
his
eyes
drawing
himself
up
obsequiously
and
from
the
way
he
walked
through
the
ranks
behind
the
generals
bending
forward
and
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
jerky
movements
and
from
the
way
he
darted
forward
at
every
word
or
gesture
of
the
commander
in
chief
it
was
evident
that
he
performed
his
duty
as
a
subordinate
with
even
greater
zeal
than
his
duty
as
a
commander
Thanks
to
the
strictness
and
assiduity
of
its
commander
the
regiment
in
comparison
with
others
that
had
reached
Braunau
at
the
same
time
was
in
splendid
condition
There
were
only
sick
and
stragglers
Everything
was
in
good
order
except
the
boots
Kutuzov
walked
through
the
ranks
sometimes
stopping
to
say
a
few
friendly
words
to
officers
he
had
known
in
the
Turkish
war
sometimes
also
to
the
soldiers
Looking
at
their
boots
he
several
times
shook
his
head
sadly
pointing
them
out
to
the
Austrian
general
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
was
not
blaming
anyone
but
could
not
help
noticing
what
a
bad
state
of
things
it
was
The
regimental
commander
ran
forward
on
each
such
occasion
fearing
to
miss
a
single
word
of
the
commander
in
chief
s
regarding
the
regiment
Behind
Kutuzov
at
a
distance
that
allowed
every
softly
spoken
word
to
be
heard
followed
some
twenty
men
of
his
suite
These
gentlemen
talked
among
themselves
and
sometimes
laughed
Nearest
of
all
to
the
commander
in
chief
walked
a
handsome
adjutant
This
was
Prince
Bolkonski
Beside
him
was
his
comrade
Nesvitski
a
tall
staff
officer
extremely
stout
with
a
kindly
smiling
handsome
face
and
moist
eyes
Nesvitski
could
hardly
keep
from
laughter
provoked
by
a
swarthy
hussar
officer
who
walked
beside
him
This
hussar
with
a
grave
face
and
without
a
smile
or
a
change
in
the
expression
of
his
fixed
eyes
watched
the
regimental
commander
s
back
and
mimicked
his
every
movement
Each
time
the
commander
started
and
bent
forward
the
hussar
started
and
bent
forward
in
exactly
the
same
manner
Nesvitski
laughed
and
nudged
the
others
to
make
them
look
at
the
wag
Kutuzov
walked
slowly
and
languidly
past
thousands
of
eyes
which
were
starting
from
their
sockets
to
watch
their
chief
On
reaching
the
third
company
he
suddenly
stopped
His
suite
not
having
expected
this
involuntarily
came
closer
to
him
Ah
Timokhin
said
he
recognizing
the
red
nosed
captain
who
had
been
reprimanded
on
account
of
the
blue
greatcoat
One
would
have
thought
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
stretch
himself
more
than
Timokhin
had
done
when
he
was
reprimanded
by
the
regimental
commander
but
now
that
the
commander
in
chief
addressed
him
he
drew
himself
up
to
such
an
extent
that
it
seemed
he
could
not
have
sustained
it
had
the
commander
in
chief
continued
to
look
at
him
and
so
Kutuzov
who
evidently
understood
his
case
and
wished
him
nothing
but
good
quickly
turned
away
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flitting
over
his
scarred
and
puffy
face
Another
Ismail
comrade
said
he
A
brave
officer
Are
you
satisfied
with
him
he
asked
the
regimental
commander
And
the
latter
unconscious
that
he
was
being
reflected
in
the
hussar
officer
as
in
a
looking
glass
started
moved
forward
and
answered
Highly
satisfied
your
excellency
We
all
have
our
weaknesses
said
Kutuzov
smiling
and
walking
away
from
him
He
used
to
have
a
predilection
for
Bacchus
The
regimental
commander
was
afraid
he
might
be
blamed
for
this
and
did
not
answer
The
hussar
at
that
moment
noticed
the
face
of
the
red
nosed
captain
and
his
drawn
in
stomach
and
mimicked
his
expression
and
pose
with
such
exactitude
that
Nesvitski
could
not
help
laughing
Kutuzov
turned
round
The
officer
evidently
had
complete
control
of
his
face
and
while
Kutuzov
was
turning
managed
to
make
a
grimace
and
then
assume
a
most
serious
deferential
and
innocent
expression
The
third
company
was
the
last
and
Kutuzov
pondered
apparently
trying
to
recollect
something
Prince
Andrew
stepped
forward
from
among
the
suite
and
said
in
French
You
told
me
to
remind
you
of
the
officer
Dolokhov
reduced
to
the
ranks
in
this
regiment
Where
is
Dolokhov
asked
Kutuzov
Dolokhov
who
had
already
changed
into
a
soldier
s
gray
greatcoat
did
not
wait
to
be
called
The
shapely
figure
of
the
fair
haired
soldier
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
stepped
forward
from
the
ranks
went
up
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
presented
arms
Have
you
a
complaint
to
make
Kutuzov
asked
with
a
slight
frown
This
is
Dolokhov
said
Prince
Andrew
Ah
said
Kutuzov
I
hope
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
Do
your
duty
The
Emperor
is
gracious
and
I
shan
t
forget
you
if
you
deserve
well
The
clear
blue
eyes
looked
at
the
commander
in
chief
just
as
boldly
as
they
had
looked
at
the
regimental
commander
seeming
by
their
expression
to
tear
open
the
veil
of
convention
that
separates
a
commander
in
chief
so
widely
from
a
private
One
thing
I
ask
of
your
excellency
Dolokhov
said
in
his
firm
ringing
deliberate
voice
I
ask
an
opportunity
to
atone
for
my
fault
and
prove
my
devotion
to
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
and
to
Russia
Kutuzov
turned
away
The
same
smile
of
the
eyes
with
which
he
had
turned
from
Captain
Timokhin
again
flitted
over
his
face
He
turned
away
with
a
grimace
as
if
to
say
that
everything
Dolokhov
had
said
to
him
and
everything
he
could
say
had
long
been
known
to
him
that
he
was
weary
of
it
and
it
was
not
at
all
what
he
wanted
He
turned
away
and
went
to
the
carriage
The
regiment
broke
up
into
companies
which
went
to
their
appointed
quarters
near
Braunau
where
they
hoped
to
receive
boots
and
clothes
and
to
rest
after
their
hard
marches
You
won
t
bear
me
a
grudge
Prokhor
Ignatych
said
the
regimental
commander
overtaking
the
third
company
on
its
way
to
its
quarters
and
riding
up
to
Captain
Timokhin
who
was
walking
in
front
The
regimental
commander
s
face
now
that
the
inspection
was
happily
over
beamed
with
irrepressible
delight
It
s
in
the
Emperor
s
service
it
can
t
be
helped
one
is
sometimes
a
bit
hasty
on
parade
I
am
the
first
to
apologize
you
know
me
He
was
very
pleased
And
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
captain
Don
t
mention
it
General
as
if
I
d
be
so
bold
replied
the
captain
his
nose
growing
redder
as
he
gave
a
smile
which
showed
where
two
front
teeth
were
missing
that
had
been
knocked
out
by
the
butt
end
of
a
gun
at
Ismail
And
tell
Mr
Dolokhov
that
I
won
t
forget
him
he
may
be
quite
easy
And
tell
me
please
I
ve
been
meaning
to
ask
how
is
he
behaving
himself
and
in
general
As
far
as
the
service
goes
he
is
quite
punctilious
your
excellency
but
his
character
said
Timokhin
And
what
about
his
character
asked
the
regimental
commander
It
s
different
on
different
days
answered
the
captain
One
day
he
is
sensible
well
educated
and
good
natured
and
the
next
he
s
a
wild
beast
In
Poland
if
you
please
he
nearly
killed
a
Jew
Oh
well
well
remarked
the
regimental
commander
Still
one
must
have
pity
on
a
young
man
in
misfortune
You
know
he
has
important
connections
Well
then
you
just
I
will
your
excellency
said
Timokhin
showing
by
his
smile
that
he
understood
his
commander
s
wish
Well
of
course
of
course
The
regimental
commander
sought
out
Dolokhov
in
the
ranks
and
reining
in
his
horse
said
to
him
After
the
next
affair
epaulettes
Dolokhov
looked
round
but
did
not
say
anything
nor
did
the
mocking
smile
on
his
lips
change
Well
that
s
all
right
continued
the
regimental
commander
A
cup
of
vodka
for
the
men
from
me
he
added
so
that
the
soldiers
could
hear
I
thank
you
all
God
be
praised
and
he
rode
past
that
company
and
overtook
the
next
one
Well
he
s
really
a
good
fellow
one
can
serve
under
him
said
Timokhin
to
the
subaltern
beside
him
In
a
word
a
hearty
one
said
the
subaltern
laughing
the
regimental
commander
was
nicknamed
King
of
Hearts
The
cheerful
mood
of
their
officers
after
the
inspection
infected
the
soldiers
The
company
marched
on
gaily
The
soldiers
voices
could
be
heard
on
every
side
And
they
said
Kutuzov
was
blind
of
one
eye
And
so
he
is
Quite
blind
No
friend
he
is
sharper
eyed
than
you
are
Boots
and
leg
bands
he
noticed
everything
When
he
looked
at
my
feet
friend
well
thinks
I
And
that
other
one
with
him
the
Austrian
looked
as
if
he
were
smeared
with
chalk
as
white
as
flour
I
suppose
they
polish
him
up
as
they
do
the
guns
I
say
Fedeshon
Did
he
say
when
the
battles
are
to
begin
You
were
near
him
Everybody
said
that
Buonaparte
himself
was
at
Braunau
Buonaparte
himself
Just
listen
to
the
fool
what
he
doesn
t
know
The
Prussians
are
up
in
arms
now
The
Austrians
you
see
are
putting
them
down
When
they
ve
been
put
down
the
war
with
Buonaparte
will
begin
And
he
says
Buonaparte
is
in
Braunau
Shows
you
re
a
fool
You
d
better
listen
more
carefully
What
devils
these
quartermasters
are
See
the
fifth
company
is
turning
into
the
village
already
they
will
have
their
buckwheat
cooked
before
we
reach
our
quarters
Give
me
a
biscuit
you
devil
And
did
you
give
me
tobacco
yesterday
That
s
just
it
friend
Ah
well
never
mind
here
you
are
They
might
call
a
halt
here
or
we
ll
have
to
do
another
four
miles
without
eating
Wasn
t
it
fine
when
those
Germans
gave
us
lifts
You
just
sit
still
and
are
drawn
along
And
here
friend
the
people
are
quite
beggarly
There
they
all
seemed
to
be
Poles
all
under
the
Russian
crown
but
here
they
re
all
regular
Germans
Singers
to
the
front
came
the
captain
s
order
And
from
the
different
ranks
some
twenty
men
ran
to
the
front
A
drummer
their
leader
turned
round
facing
the
singers
and
flourishing
his
arm
began
a
long
drawn
out
soldiers
song
commencing
with
the
words
Morning
dawned
the
sun
was
rising
and
concluding
On
then
brothers
on
to
glory
led
by
Father
Kamenski
This
song
had
been
composed
in
the
Turkish
campaign
and
now
being
sung
in
Austria
the
only
change
being
that
the
words
Father
Kamenski
were
replaced
by
Father
Kutuzov
Having
jerked
out
these
last
words
as
soldiers
do
and
waved
his
arms
as
if
flinging
something
to
the
ground
the
drummer
a
lean
handsome
soldier
of
forty
looked
sternly
at
the
singers
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
Then
having
satisfied
himself
that
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
he
raised
both
arms
as
if
carefully
lifting
some
invisible
but
precious
object
above
his
head
and
holding
it
there
for
some
seconds
suddenly
flung
it
down
and
began
Oh
my
bower
oh
my
bower
Oh
my
bower
new
chimed
in
twenty
voices
and
the
castanet
player
in
spite
of
the
burden
of
his
equipment
rushed
out
to
the
front
and
walking
backwards
before
the
company
jerked
his
shoulders
and
flourished
his
castanets
as
if
threatening
someone
The
soldiers
swinging
their
arms
and
keeping
time
spontaneously
marched
with
long
steps
Behind
the
company
the
sound
of
wheels
the
creaking
of
springs
and
the
tramp
of
horses
hoofs
were
heard
Kutuzov
and
his
suite
were
returning
to
the
town
The
commander
in
chief
made
a
sign
that
the
men
should
continue
to
march
at
ease
and
he
and
all
his
suite
showed
pleasure
at
the
sound
of
the
singing
and
the
sight
of
the
dancing
soldier
and
the
gay
and
smartly
marching
men
In
the
second
file
from
the
right
flank
beside
which
the
carriage
passed
the
company
a
blue
eyed
soldier
involuntarily
attracted
notice
It
was
Dolokhov
marching
with
particular
grace
and
boldness
in
time
to
the
song
and
looking
at
those
driving
past
as
if
he
pitied
all
who
were
not
at
that
moment
marching
with
the
company
The
hussar
cornet
of
Kutuzov
s
suite
who
had
mimicked
the
regimental
commander
fell
back
from
the
carriage
and
rode
up
to
Dolokhov
Hussar
cornet
Zherkov
had
at
one
time
in
Petersburg
belonged
to
the
wild
set
led
by
Dolokhov
Zherkov
had
met
Dolokhov
abroad
as
a
private
and
had
not
seen
fit
to
recognize
him
But
now
that
Kutuzov
had
spoken
to
the
gentleman
ranker
he
addressed
him
with
the
cordiality
of
an
old
friend
My
dear
fellow
how
are
you
said
he
through
the
singing
making
his
horse
keep
pace
with
the
company
How
am
I
Dolokhov
answered
coldly
I
am
as
you
see
The
lively
song
gave
a
special
flavor
to
the
tone
of
free
and
easy
gaiety
with
which
Zherkov
spoke
and
to
the
intentional
coldness
of
Dolokhov
s
reply
And
how
do
you
get
on
with
the
officers
inquired
Zherkov
All
right
They
are
good
fellows
And
how
have
you
wriggled
onto
the
staff
I
was
attached
I
m
on
duty
Both
were
silent
She
let
the
hawk
fly
upward
from
her
wide
right
sleeve
went
the
song
arousing
an
involuntary
sensation
of
courage
and
cheerfulness
Their
conversation
would
probably
have
been
different
but
for
the
effect
of
that
song
Is
it
true
that
Austrians
have
been
beaten
asked
Dolokhov
The
devil
only
knows
They
say
so
I
m
glad
answered
Dolokhov
briefly
and
clearly
as
the
song
demanded
I
say
come
round
some
evening
and
we
ll
have
a
game
of
faro
said
Zherkov
Why
have
you
too
much
money
Do
come
I
can
t
I
ve
sworn
not
to
I
won
t
drink
and
won
t
play
till
I
get
reinstated
Well
that
s
only
till
the
first
engagement
We
shall
see
They
were
again
silent
Come
if
you
need
anything
One
can
at
least
be
of
use
on
the
staff
Dolokhov
smiled
Don
t
trouble
If
I
want
anything
I
won
t
beg
I
ll
take
it
Well
never
mind
I
only
And
I
only
Good
bye
Good
health
It
s
a
long
long
way
To
my
native
land
Zherkov
touched
his
horse
with
the
spurs
it
pranced
excitedly
from
foot
to
foot
uncertain
with
which
to
start
then
settled
down
galloped
past
the
company
and
overtook
the
carriage
still
keeping
time
to
the
song
On
returning
from
the
review
Kutuzov
took
the
Austrian
general
into
his
private
room
and
calling
his
adjutant
asked
for
some
papers
relating
to
the
condition
of
the
troops
on
their
arrival
and
the
letters
that
had
come
from
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
who
was
in
command
of
the
advanced
army
Prince
Andrew
Bolkonski
came
into
the
room
with
the
required
papers
Kutuzov
and
the
Austrian
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
were
sitting
at
the
table
on
which
a
plan
was
spread
out
Ah
said
Kutuzov
glancing
at
Bolkonski
as
if
by
this
exclamation
he
was
asking
the
adjutant
to
wait
and
he
went
on
with
the
conversation
in
French
All
I
can
say
General
said
he
with
a
pleasant
elegance
of
expression
and
intonation
that
obliged
one
to
listen
to
each
deliberately
spoken
word
It
was
evident
that
Kutuzov
himself
listened
with
pleasure
to
his
own
voice
All
I
can
say
General
is
that
if
the
matter
depended
on
my
personal
wishes
the
will
of
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
Francis
would
have
been
fulfilled
long
ago
I
should
long
ago
have
joined
the
archduke
And
believe
me
on
my
honour
that
to
me
personally
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
hand
over
the
supreme
command
of
the
army
into
the
hands
of
a
better
informed
and
more
skillful
general
of
whom
Austria
has
so
many
and
to
lay
down
all
this
heavy
responsibility
But
circumstances
are
sometimes
too
strong
for
us
General
And
Kutuzov
smiled
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
say
You
are
quite
at
liberty
not
to
believe
me
and
I
don
t
even
care
whether
you
do
or
not
but
you
have
no
grounds
for
telling
me
so
And
that
is
the
whole
point
The
Austrian
general
looked
dissatisfied
but
had
no
option
but
to
reply
in
the
same
tone
On
the
contrary
he
said
in
a
querulous
and
angry
tone
that
contrasted
with
his
flattering
words
on
the
contrary
your
excellency
s
participation
in
the
common
action
is
highly
valued
by
His
Majesty
but
we
think
the
present
delay
is
depriving
the
splendid
Russian
troops
and
their
commander
of
the
laurels
they
have
been
accustomed
to
win
in
their
battles
he
concluded
his
evidently
prearranged
sentence
Kutuzov
bowed
with
the
same
smile
But
that
is
my
conviction
and
judging
by
the
last
letter
with
which
His
Highness
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
has
honored
me
I
imagine
that
the
Austrian
troops
under
the
direction
of
so
skillful
a
leader
as
General
Mack
have
by
now
already
gained
a
decisive
victory
and
no
longer
need
our
aid
said
Kutuzov
The
general
frowned
Though
there
was
no
definite
news
of
an
Austrian
defeat
there
were
many
circumstances
confirming
the
unfavorable
rumors
that
were
afloat
and
so
Kutuzov
s
suggestion
of
an
Austrian
victory
sounded
much
like
irony
But
Kutuzov
went
on
blandly
smiling
with
the
same
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
had
a
right
to
suppose
so
And
in
fact
the
last
letter
he
had
received
from
Mack
s
army
informed
him
of
a
victory
and
stated
strategically
the
position
of
the
army
was
very
favorable
Give
me
that
letter
said
Kutuzov
turning
to
Prince
Andrew
Please
have
a
look
at
it
and
Kutuzov
with
an
ironical
smile
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
read
to
the
Austrian
general
the
following
passage
in
German
from
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
s
letter
We
have
fully
concentrated
forces
of
nearly
seventy
thousand
men
with
which
to
attack
and
defeat
the
enemy
should
he
cross
the
Lech
Also
as
we
are
masters
of
Ulm
we
cannot
be
deprived
of
the
advantage
of
commanding
both
sides
of
the
Danube
so
that
should
the
enemy
not
cross
the
Lech
we
can
cross
the
Danube
throw
ourselves
on
his
line
of
communications
recross
the
river
lower
down
and
frustrate
his
intention
should
he
try
to
direct
his
whole
force
against
our
faithful
ally
We
shall
therefore
confidently
await
the
moment
when
the
Imperial
Russian
army
will
be
fully
equipped
and
shall
then
in
conjunction
with
it
easily
find
a
way
to
prepare
for
the
enemy
the
fate
he
deserves
Kutuzov
sighed
deeply
on
finishing
this
paragraph
and
looked
at
the
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
mildly
and
attentively
But
you
know
the
wise
maxim
your
excellency
advising
one
to
expect
the
worst
said
the
Austrian
general
evidently
wishing
to
have
done
with
jests
and
to
come
to
business
He
involuntarily
looked
round
at
the
aide
de
camp
Excuse
me
General
interrupted
Kutuzov
also
turning
to
Prince
Andrew
Look
here
my
dear
fellow
get
from
Kozlovski
all
the
reports
from
our
scouts
Here
are
two
letters
from
Count
Nostitz
and
here
is
one
from
His
Highness
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
and
here
are
these
he
said
handing
him
several
papers
make
a
neat
memorandum
in
French
out
of
all
this
showing
all
the
news
we
have
had
of
the
movements
of
the
Austrian
army
and
then
give
it
to
his
excellency
Prince
Andrew
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
having
understood
from
the
first
not
only
what
had
been
said
but
also
what
Kutuzov
would
have
liked
to
tell
him
He
gathered
up
the
papers
and
with
a
bow
to
both
stepped
softly
over
the
carpet
and
went
out
into
the
waiting
room
Though
not
much
time
had
passed
since
Prince
Andrew
had
left
Russia
he
had
changed
greatly
during
that
period
In
the
expression
of
his
face
in
his
movements
in
his
walk
scarcely
a
trace
was
left
of
his
former
affected
languor
and
indolence
He
now
looked
like
a
man
who
has
time
to
think
of
the
impression
he
makes
on
others
but
is
occupied
with
agreeable
and
interesting
work
His
face
expressed
more
satisfaction
with
himself
and
those
around
him
his
smile
and
glance
were
brighter
and
more
attractive
Kutuzov
whom
he
had
overtaken
in
Poland
had
received
him
very
kindly
promised
not
to
forget
him
distinguished
him
above
the
other
adjutants
and
had
taken
him
to
Vienna
and
given
him
the
more
serious
commissions
From
Vienna
Kutuzov
wrote
to
his
old
comrade
Prince
Andrew
s
father
Your
son
bids
fair
to
become
an
officer
distinguished
by
his
industry
firmness
and
expedition
I
consider
myself
fortunate
to
have
such
a
subordinate
by
me
On
Kutuzov
s
staff
among
his
fellow
officers
and
in
the
army
generally
Prince
Andrew
had
as
he
had
had
in
Petersburg
society
two
quite
opposite
reputations
Some
a
minority
acknowledged
him
to
be
different
from
themselves
and
from
everyone
else
expected
great
things
of
him
listened
to
him
admired
and
imitated
him
and
with
them
Prince
Andrew
was
natural
and
pleasant
Others
the
majority
disliked
him
and
considered
him
conceited
cold
and
disagreeable
But
among
these
people
Prince
Andrew
knew
how
to
take
his
stand
so
that
they
respected
and
even
feared
him
Coming
out
of
Kutuzov
s
room
into
the
waiting
room
with
the
papers
in
his
hand
Prince
Andrew
came
up
to
his
comrade
the
aide
de
camp
on
duty
Kozlovski
who
was
sitting
at
the
window
with
a
book
Well
Prince
asked
Kozlovski
I
am
ordered
to
write
a
memorandum
explaining
why
we
are
not
advancing
And
why
is
it
Prince
Andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
Any
news
from
Mack
No
If
it
were
true
that
he
has
been
beaten
news
would
have
come
Probably
said
Prince
Andrew
moving
toward
the
outer
door
But
at
that
instant
a
tall
Austrian
general
in
a
greatcoat
with
the
order
of
Maria
Theresa
on
his
neck
and
a
black
bandage
round
his
head
who
had
evidently
just
arrived
entered
quickly
slamming
the
door
Prince
Andrew
stopped
short
Commander
in
Chief
Kutuzov
said
the
newly
arrived
general
speaking
quickly
with
a
harsh
German
accent
looking
to
both
sides
and
advancing
straight
toward
the
inner
door
The
commander
in
chief
is
engaged
said
Kozlovski
going
hurriedly
up
to
the
unknown
general
and
blocking
his
way
to
the
door
Whom
shall
I
announce
The
unknown
general
looked
disdainfully
down
at
Kozlovski
who
was
rather
short
as
if
surprised
that
anyone
should
not
know
him
The
commander
in
chief
is
engaged
repeated
Kozlovski
calmly
The
general
s
face
clouded
his
lips
quivered
and
trembled
He
took
out
a
notebook
hurriedly
scribbled
something
in
pencil
tore
out
the
leaf
gave
it
to
Kozlovski
stepped
quickly
to
the
window
and
threw
himself
into
a
chair
gazing
at
those
in
the
room
as
if
asking
Why
do
they
look
at
me
Then
he
lifted
his
head
stretched
his
neck
as
if
he
intended
to
say
something
but
immediately
with
affected
indifference
began
to
hum
to
himself
producing
a
queer
sound
which
immediately
broke
off
The
door
of
the
private
room
opened
and
Kutuzov
appeared
in
the
doorway
The
general
with
the
bandaged
head
bent
forward
as
though
running
away
from
some
danger
and
making
long
quick
strides
with
his
thin
legs
went
up
to
Kutuzov
Vous
voyez
le
malheureux
Mack
he
uttered
in
a
broken
voice
Kutuzov
s
face
as
he
stood
in
the
open
doorway
remained
perfectly
immobile
for
a
few
moments
Then
wrinkles
ran
over
his
face
like
a
wave
and
his
forehead
became
smooth
again
he
bowed
his
head
respectfully
closed
his
eyes
silently
let
Mack
enter
his
room
before
him
and
closed
the
door
himself
behind
him
The
report
which
had
been
circulated
that
the
Austrians
had
been
beaten
and
that
the
whole
army
had
surrendered
at
Ulm
proved
to
be
correct
Within
half
an
hour
adjutants
had
been
sent
in
various
directions
with
orders
which
showed
that
the
Russian
troops
who
had
hitherto
been
inactive
would
also
soon
have
to
meet
the
enemy
Prince
Andrew
was
one
of
those
rare
staff
officers
whose
chief
interest
lay
in
the
general
progress
of
the
war
When
he
saw
Mack
and
heard
the
details
of
his
disaster
he
understood
that
half
the
campaign
was
lost
understood
all
the
difficulties
of
the
Russian
army
s
position
and
vividly
imagined
what
awaited
it
and
the
part
he
would
have
to
play
Involuntarily
he
felt
a
joyful
agitation
at
the
thought
of
the
humiliation
of
arrogant
Austria
and
that
in
a
week
s
time
he
might
perhaps
see
and
take
part
in
the
first
Russian
encounter
with
the
French
since
Suvorov
met
them
He
feared
that
Bonaparte
s
genius
might
outweigh
all
the
courage
of
the
Russian
troops
and
at
the
same
time
could
not
admit
the
idea
of
his
hero
being
disgraced
Excited
and
irritated
by
these
thoughts
Prince
Andrew
went
toward
his
room
to
write
to
his
father
to
whom
he
wrote
every
day
In
the
corridor
he
met
Nesvitski
with
whom
he
shared
a
room
and
the
wag
Zherkov
they
were
as
usual
laughing
Why
are
you
so
glum
asked
Nesvitski
noticing
Prince
Andrew
s
pale
face
and
glittering
eyes
There
s
nothing
to
be
gay
about
answered
Bolkonski
Just
as
Prince
Andrew
met
Nesvitski
and
Zherkov
there
came
toward
them
from
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
Strauch
an
Austrian
general
who
on
Kutuzov
s
staff
in
charge
of
the
provisioning
of
the
Russian
army
and
the
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
who
had
arrived
the
previous
evening
There
was
room
enough
in
the
wide
corridor
for
the
generals
to
pass
the
three
officers
quite
easily
but
Zherkov
pushing
Nesvitski
aside
with
his
arm
said
in
a
breathless
voice
They
re
coming
they
re
coming
Stand
aside
make
way
please
make
way
The
generals
were
passing
by
looking
as
if
they
wished
to
avoid
embarrassing
attentions
On
the
face
of
the
wag
Zherkov
there
suddenly
appeared
a
stupid
smile
of
glee
which
he
seemed
unable
to
suppress
Your
excellency
said
he
in
German
stepping
forward
and
addressing
the
Austrian
general
I
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
He
bowed
his
head
and
scraped
first
with
one
foot
and
then
with
the
other
awkwardly
like
a
child
at
a
dancing
lesson
The
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
looked
at
him
severely
but
seeing
the
seriousness
of
his
stupid
smile
could
not
but
give
him
a
moment
s
attention
He
screwed
up
his
eyes
showing
that
he
was
listening
I
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
General
Mack
has
arrived
quite
well
only
a
little
bruised
just
here
he
added
pointing
with
a
beaming
smile
to
his
head
The
general
frowned
turned
away
and
went
on
Gott
wie
naiv
said
he
angrily
after
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
Good
God
what
simplicity
Nesvitski
with
a
laugh
threw
his
arms
round
Prince
Andrew
but
Bolkonski
turning
still
paler
pushed
him
away
with
an
angry
look
and
turned
to
Zherkov
The
nervous
irritation
aroused
by
the
appearance
of
Mack
the
news
of
his
defeat
and
the
thought
of
what
lay
before
the
Russian
army
found
vent
in
anger
at
Zherkov
s
untimely
jest
If
you
sir
choose
to
make
a
buffoon
of
yourself
he
said
sharply
with
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lower
jaw
I
can
t
prevent
your
doing
so
but
I
warn
you
that
if
you
dare
to
play
the
fool
in
my
presence
I
will
teach
you
to
behave
yourself
Nesvitski
and
Zherkov
were
so
surprised
by
this
outburst
that
they
gazed
at
Bolkonski
silently
with
wide
open
eyes
What
s
the
matter
I
only
congratulated
them
said
Zherkov
I
am
not
jesting
with
you
please
be
silent
cried
Bolkonski
and
taking
Nesvitski
s
arm
he
left
Zherkov
who
did
not
know
what
to
say
Come
what
s
the
matter
old
fellow
said
Nesvitski
trying
to
soothe
him
What
s
the
matter
exclaimed
Prince
Andrew
standing
still
in
his
excitement
Don
t
you
understand
that
either
we
are
officers
serving
our
Tsar
and
our
country
rejoicing
in
the
successes
and
grieving
at
the
misfortunes
of
our
common
cause
or
we
are
merely
lackeys
who
care
nothing
for
their
master
s
business
Quarante
mille
hommes
massacres
et
l
armee
de
nos
allies
detruite
et
vous
trouvez
la
le
mot
pour
rire
he
said
as
if
strengthening
his
views
by
this
French
sentence
C
est
bien
pour
un
garcon
de
rien
comme
cet
individu
dont
vous
avez
fait
un
ami
mais
pas
pour
vous
pas
pour
vous
Only
a
hobbledehoy
could
amuse
himself
in
this
way
he
added
in
Russian
but
pronouncing
the
word
with
a
French
accent
having
noticed
that
Zherkov
could
still
hear
him
Forty
thousand
men
massacred
and
the
army
of
our
allies
destroyed
and
you
find
that
a
cause
for
jesting
It
is
all
very
well
for
that
good
for
nothing
fellow
of
whom
you
have
made
a
friend
but
not
for
you
not
for
you
He
waited
a
moment
to
see
whether
the
cornet
would
answer
but
he
turned
and
went
out
of
the
corridor
The
Pavlograd
Hussars
were
stationed
two
miles
from
Braunau
The
squadron
in
which
Nicholas
Rostov
served
as
a
cadet
was
quartered
in
the
German
village
of
Salzeneck
The
best
quarters
in
the
village
were
assigned
to
cavalry
captain
Denisov
the
squadron
commander
known
throughout
the
whole
cavalry
division
as
Vaska
Denisov
Cadet
Rostov
ever
since
he
had
overtaken
the
regiment
in
Poland
had
lived
with
the
squadron
commander
On
October
the
day
when
all
was
astir
at
headquarters
over
the
news
of
Mack
s
defeat
the
camp
life
of
the
officers
of
this
squadron
was
proceeding
as
usual
Denisov
who
had
been
losing
at
cards
all
night
had
not
yet
come
home
when
Rostov
rode
back
early
in
the
morning
from
a
foraging
expedition
Rostov
in
his
cadet
uniform
with
a
jerk
to
his
horse
rode
up
to
the
porch
swung
his
leg
over
the
saddle
with
a
supple
youthful
movement
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
stirrup
as
if
loathe
to
part
from
his
horse
and
at
last
sprang
down
and
called
to
his
orderly
Ah
Bondarenko
dear
friend
said
he
to
the
hussar
who
rushed
up
headlong
to
the
horse
Walk
him
up
and
down
my
dear
fellow
he
continued
with
that
gay
brotherly
cordiality
which
goodhearted
young
people
show
to
everyone
when
they
are
happy
Yes
your
excellency
answered
the
Ukrainian
gaily
tossing
his
head
Mind
walk
him
up
and
down
well
Another
hussar
also
rushed
toward
the
horse
but
Bondarenko
had
already
thrown
the
reins
of
the
snaffle
bridle
over
the
horse
s
head
It
was
evident
that
the
cadet
was
liberal
with
his
tips
and
that
it
paid
to
serve
him
Rostov
patted
the
horse
s
neck
and
then
his
flank
and
lingered
for
a
moment
Splendid
What
a
horse
he
will
be
he
thought
with
a
smile
and
holding
up
his
saber
his
spurs
jingling
he
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
His
landlord
who
in
a
waistcoat
and
a
pointed
cap
pitchfork
in
hand
was
clearing
manure
from
the
cowhouse
looked
out
and
his
face
immediately
brightened
on
seeing
Rostov
Schon
gut
Morgen
Schon
gut
Morgen
he
said
winking
with
a
merry
smile
evidently
pleased
to
greet
the
young
man
A
very
good
morning
A
very
good
morning
Schon
fleissig
said
Rostov
with
the
same
gay
brotherly
smile
which
did
not
leave
his
eager
face
Hoch
Oestreicher
Hoch
Russen
Kaiser
Alexander
hoch
said
he
quoting
words
often
repeated
by
the
German
landlord
Busy
already
Hurrah
for
the
Austrians
Hurrah
for
the
Russians
Hurrah
for
Emperor
Alexander
The
German
laughed
came
out
of
the
cowshed
pulled
off
his
cap
and
waving
it
above
his
head
cried
Und
die
ganze
Welt
hoch
And
hurrah
for
the
whole
world
Rostov
waved
his
cap
above
his
head
like
the
German
and
cried
laughing
Und
vivat
die
ganze
Welt
Though
neither
the
German
cleaning
his
cowshed
nor
Rostov
back
with
his
platoon
from
foraging
for
hay
had
any
reason
for
rejoicing
they
looked
at
each
other
with
joyful
delight
and
brotherly
love
wagged
their
heads
in
token
of
their
mutual
affection
and
parted
smiling
the
German
returning
to
his
cowshed
and
Rostov
going
to
the
cottage
he
occupied
with
Denisov
What
about
your
master
he
asked
Lavrushka
Denisov
s
orderly
whom
all
the
regiment
knew
for
a
rogue
Hasn
t
been
in
since
the
evening
Must
have
been
losing
answered
Lavrushka
I
know
by
now
if
he
wins
he
comes
back
early
to
brag
about
it
but
if
he
stays
out
till
morning
it
means
he
s
lost
and
will
come
back
in
a
rage
Will
you
have
coffee
Yes
bring
some
Ten
minutes
later
Lavrushka
brought
the
coffee
He
s
coming
said
he
Now
for
trouble
Rostov
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
Denisov
coming
home
Denisov
was
a
small
man
with
a
red
face
sparkling
black
eyes
and
black
tousled
mustache
and
hair
He
wore
an
unfastened
cloak
wide
breeches
hanging
down
in
creases
and
a
crumpled
shako
on
the
back
of
his
head
He
came
up
to
the
porch
gloomily
hanging
his
head
Lavwuska
he
shouted
loudly
and
angrily
take
it
off
blockhead
Well
I
am
taking
it
off
replied
Lavrushka
s
voice
Ah
you
re
up
already
said
Denisov
entering
the
room
Long
ago
answered
Rostov
I
have
already
been
for
the
hay
and
have
seen
Fraulein
Mathilde
Weally
And
I
ve
been
losing
bwother
I
lost
yesterday
like
a
damned
fool
cried
Denisov
not
pronouncing
his
r
s
Such
ill
luck
Such
ill
luck
As
soon
as
you
left
it
began
and
went
on
Hullo
there
Tea
Puckering
up
his
face
though
smiling
and
showing
his
short
strong
teeth
he
began
with
stubby
fingers
of
both
hands
to
ruffle
up
his
thick
tangled
black
hair
And
what
devil
made
me
go
to
that
wat
an
officer
nicknamed
the
rat
he
said
rubbing
his
forehead
and
whole
face
with
both
hands
Just
fancy
he
didn
t
let
me
win
a
single
cahd
not
one
cahd
He
took
the
lighted
pipe
that
was
offered
to
him
gripped
it
in
his
fist
and
tapped
it
on
the
floor
making
the
sparks
fly
while
he
continued
to
shout
He
lets
one
win
the
singles
and
collahs
it
as
soon
as
one
doubles
it
gives
the
singles
and
snatches
the
doubles
He
scattered
the
burning
tobacco
smashed
the
pipe
and
threw
it
away
Then
he
remained
silent
for
a
while
and
all
at
once
looked
cheerfully
with
his
glittering
black
eyes
at
Rostov
If
at
least
we
had
some
women
here
but
there
s
nothing
foh
one
to
do
but
dwink
If
we
could
only
get
to
fighting
soon
Hullo
who
s
there
he
said
turning
to
the
door
as
he
heard
a
tread
of
heavy
boots
and
the
clinking
of
spurs
that
came
to
a
stop
and
a
respectful
cough
The
squadron
quartermaster
said
Lavrushka
Denisov
s
face
puckered
still
more
Wetched
he
muttered
throwing
down
a
purse
with
some
gold
in
it
Wostov
deah
fellow
just
see
how
much
there
is
left
and
shove
the
purse
undah
the
pillow
he
said
and
went
out
to
the
quartermaster
Rostov
took
the
money
and
mechanically
arranging
the
old
and
new
coins
in
separate
piles
began
counting
them
Ah
Telyanin
How
d
ye
do
They
plucked
me
last
night
came
Denisov
s
voice
from
the
next
room
Where
At
Bykov
s
at
the
rat
s
I
knew
it
replied
a
piping
voice
and
Lieutenant
Telyanin
a
small
officer
of
the
same
squadron
entered
the
room
Rostov
thrust
the
purse
under
the
pillow
and
shook
the
damp
little
hand
which
was
offered
him
Telyanin
for
some
reason
had
been
transferred
from
the
Guards
just
before
this
campaign
He
behaved
very
well
in
the
regiment
but
was
not
liked
Rostov
especially
detested
him
and
was
unable
to
overcome
or
conceal
his
groundless
antipathy
to
the
man
Well
young
cavalryman
how
is
my
Rook
behaving
he
asked
Rook
was
a
young
horse
Telyanin
had
sold
to
Rostov
The
lieutenant
never
looked
the
man
he
was
speaking
to
straight
in
the
face
his
eyes
continually
wandered
from
one
object
to
another
I
saw
you
riding
this
morning
he
added
Oh
he
s
all
right
a
good
horse
answered
Rostov
though
the
horse
for
which
he
had
paid
seven
hundred
rubbles
was
not
worth
half
that
sum
He
s
begun
to
go
a
little
lame
on
the
left
foreleg
he
added
The
hoof
s
cracked
That
s
nothing
I
ll
teach
you
what
to
do
and
show
you
what
kind
of
rivet
to
use
Yes
please
do
said
Rostov
I
ll
show
you
I
ll
show
you
It
s
not
a
secret
And
it
s
a
horse
you
ll
thank
me
for
Then
I
ll
have
it
brought
round
said
Rostov
wishing
to
avoid
Telyanin
and
he
went
out
to
give
the
order
In
the
passage
Denisov
with
a
pipe
was
squatting
on
the
threshold
facing
the
quartermaster
who
was
reporting
to
him
On
seeing
Rostov
Denisov
screwed
up
his
face
and
pointing
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
to
the
room
where
Telyanin
was
sitting
he
frowned
and
gave
a
shudder
of
disgust
Ugh
I
don
t
like
that
fellow
he
said
regardless
of
the
quartermaster
s
presence
Rostov
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
Nor
do
I
but
what
s
one
to
do
and
having
given
his
order
he
returned
to
Telyanin
Telyanin
was
sitting
in
the
same
indolent
pose
in
which
Rostov
had
left
him
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
Well
there
certainly
are
disgusting
people
thought
Rostov
as
he
entered
Have
you
told
them
to
bring
the
horse
asked
Telyanin
getting
up
and
looking
carelessly
about
him
I
have
Let
us
go
ourselves
I
only
came
round
to
ask
Denisov
about
yesterday
s
order
Have
you
got
it
Denisov
Not
yet
But
where
are
you
off
to
I
want
to
teach
this
young
man
how
to
shoe
a
horse
said
Telyanin
They
went
through
the
porch
and
into
the
stable
The
lieutenant
explained
how
to
rivet
the
hoof
and
went
away
to
his
own
quarters
When
Rostov
went
back
there
was
a
bottle
of
vodka
and
a
sausage
on
the
table
Denisov
was
sitting
there
scratching
with
his
pen
on
a
sheet
of
paper
He
looked
gloomily
in
Rostov
s
face
and
said
I
am
witing
to
her
He
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and
evidently
glad
of
a
chance
to
say
quicker
in
words
what
he
wanted
to
write
told
Rostov
the
contents
of
his
letter
You
see
my
fwiend
he
said
we
sleep
when
we
don
t
love
We
are
childwen
of
the
dust
but
one
falls
in
love
and
one
is
a
God
one
is
pua
as
on
the
first
day
of
cweation
Who
s
that
now
Send
him
to
the
devil
I
m
busy
he
shouted
to
Lavrushka
who
went
up
to
him
not
in
the
least
abashed
Who
should
it
be
You
yourself
told
him
to
come
It
s
the
quartermaster
for
the
money
Denisov
frowned
and
was
about
to
shout
some
reply
but
stopped
Wetched
business
he
muttered
to
himself
How
much
is
left
in
the
puhse
he
asked
turning
to
Rostov
Seven
new
and
three
old
imperials
Oh
it
s
wetched
Well
what
are
you
standing
there
for
you
sca
cwow
Call
the
quahtehmasteh
he
shouted
to
Lavrushka
Please
Denisov
let
me
lend
you
some
I
have
some
you
know
said
Rostov
blushing
Don
t
like
bowwowing
from
my
own
fellows
I
don
t
growled
Denisov
But
if
you
won
t
accept
money
from
me
like
a
comrade
you
will
offend
me
Really
I
have
some
Rostov
repeated
No
I
tell
you
And
Denisov
went
to
the
bed
to
get
the
purse
from
under
the
pillow
Where
have
you
put
it
Wostov
Under
the
lower
pillow
It
s
not
there
Denisov
threw
both
pillows
on
the
floor
The
purse
was
not
there
That
s
a
miwacle
Wait
haven
t
you
dropped
it
said
Rostov
picking
up
the
pillows
one
at
a
time
and
shaking
them
He
pulled
off
the
quilt
and
shook
it
The
purse
was
not
there
Dear
me
can
I
have
forgotten
No
I
remember
thinking
that
you
kept
it
under
your
head
like
a
treasure
said
Rostov
I
put
it
just
here
Where
is
it
he
asked
turning
to
Lavrushka
I
haven
t
been
in
the
room
It
must
be
where
you
put
it
But
it
isn
t
You
re
always
like
that
you
thwow
a
thing
down
anywhere
and
forget
it
Feel
in
your
pockets
No
if
I
hadn
t
thought
of
it
being
a
treasure
said
Rostov
but
I
remember
putting
it
there
Lavrushka
turned
all
the
bedding
over
looked
under
the
bed
and
under
the
table
searched
everywhere
and
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
Denisov
silently
watched
Lavrushka
s
movements
and
when
the
latter
threw
up
his
arms
in
surprise
saying
it
was
nowhere
to
be
found
Denisov
glanced
at
Rostov
Wostov
you
ve
not
been
playing
schoolboy
twicks
Rostov
felt
Denisov
s
gaze
fixed
on
him
raised
his
eyes
and
instantly
dropped
them
again
All
the
blood
which
had
seemed
congested
somewhere
below
his
throat
rushed
to
his
face
and
eyes
He
could
not
draw
breath
And
there
hasn
t
been
anyone
in
the
room
except
the
lieutenant
and
yourselves
It
must
be
here
somewhere
said
Lavrushka
Now
then
you
devil
s
puppet
look
alive
and
hunt
for
it
shouted
Denisov
suddenly
turning
purple
and
rushing
at
the
man
with
a
threatening
gesture
If
the
purse
isn
t
found
I
ll
flog
you
I
ll
flog
you
all
Rostov
his
eyes
avoiding
Denisov
began
buttoning
his
coat
buckled
on
his
saber
and
put
on
his
cap
I
must
have
that
purse
I
tell
you
shouted
Denisov
shaking
his
orderly
by
the
shoulders
and
knocking
him
against
the
wall
Denisov
let
him
alone
I
know
who
has
taken
it
said
Rostov
going
toward
the
door
without
raising
his
eyes
Denisov
paused
thought
a
moment
and
evidently
understanding
what
Rostov
hinted
at
seized
his
arm
Nonsense
he
cried
and
the
veins
on
his
forehead
and
neck
stood
out
like
cords
You
are
mad
I
tell
you
I
won
t
allow
it
The
purse
is
here
I
ll
flay
this
scoundwel
alive
and
it
will
be
found
I
know
who
has
taken
it
repeated
Rostov
in
an
unsteady
voice
and
went
to
the
door
And
I
tell
you
don
t
you
dahe
to
do
it
shouted
Denisov
rushing
at
the
cadet
to
restrain
him
But
Rostov
pulled
away
his
arm
and
with
as
much
anger
as
though
Denisov
were
his
worst
enemy
firmly
fixed
his
eyes
directly
on
his
face
Do
you
understand
what
you
re
saying
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
There
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
except
myself
So
that
if
it
is
not
so
then
He
could
not
finish
and
ran
out
of
the
room
Ah
may
the
devil
take
you
and
evewybody
were
the
last
words
Rostov
heard
Rostov
went
to
Telyanin
s
quarters
The
master
is
not
in
he
s
gone
to
headquarters
said
Telyanin
s
orderly
Has
something
happened
he
added
surprised
at
the
cadet
s
troubled
face
No
nothing
You
ve
only
just
missed
him
said
the
orderly
The
headquarters
were
situated
two
miles
away
from
Salzeneck
and
Rostov
without
returning
home
took
a
horse
and
rode
there
There
was
an
inn
in
the
village
which
the
officers
frequented
Rostov
rode
up
to
it
and
saw
Telyanin
s
horse
at
the
porch
In
the
second
room
of
the
inn
the
lieutenant
was
sitting
over
a
dish
of
sausages
and
a
bottle
of
wine
Ah
you
ve
come
here
too
young
man
he
said
smiling
and
raising
his
eyebrows
Yes
said
Rostov
as
if
it
cost
him
a
great
deal
to
utter
the
word
and
he
sat
down
at
the
nearest
table
Both
were
silent
There
were
two
Germans
and
a
Russian
officer
in
the
room
No
one
spoke
and
the
only
sounds
heard
were
the
clatter
of
knives
and
the
munching
of
the
lieutenant
When
Telyanin
had
finished
his
lunch
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
double
purse
and
drawing
its
rings
aside
with
his
small
white
turned
up
fingers
drew
out
a
gold
imperial
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
gave
it
to
the
waiter
Please
be
quick
he
said
The
coin
was
a
new
one
Rostov
rose
and
went
up
to
Telyanin
Allow
me
to
look
at
your
purse
he
said
in
a
low
almost
inaudible
voice
With
shifting
eyes
but
eyebrows
still
raised
Telyanin
handed
him
the
purse
Yes
it
s
a
nice
purse
Yes
yes
he
said
growing
suddenly
pale
and
added
Look
at
it
young
man
Rostov
took
the
purse
in
his
hand
examined
it
and
the
money
in
it
and
looked
at
Telyanin
The
lieutenant
was
looking
about
in
his
usual
way
and
suddenly
seemed
to
grow
very
merry
If
we
get
to
Vienna
I
ll
get
rid
of
it
there
but
in
these
wretched
little
towns
there
s
nowhere
to
spend
it
said
he
Well
let
me
have
it
young
man
I
m
going
Rostov
did
not
speak
And
you
Are
you
going
to
have
lunch
too
They
feed
you
quite
decently
here
continued
Telyanin
Now
then
let
me
have
it
He
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
hold
of
the
purse
Rostov
let
go
of
it
Telyanin
took
the
purse
and
began
carelessly
slipping
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
riding
breeches
with
his
eyebrows
lifted
and
his
mouth
slightly
open
as
if
to
say
Yes
yes
I
am
putting
my
purse
in
my
pocket
and
that
s
quite
simple
and
is
no
one
else
s
business
Well
young
man
he
said
with
a
sigh
and
from
under
his
lifted
brows
he
glanced
into
Rostov
s
eyes
Some
flash
as
of
an
electric
spark
shot
from
Telyanin
s
eyes
to
Rostov
s
and
back
and
back
again
and
again
in
an
instant
Come
here
said
Rostov
catching
hold
of
Telyanin
s
arm
and
almost
dragging
him
to
the
window
That
money
is
Denisov
s
you
took
it
he
whispered
just
above
Telyanin
s
ear
What
What
How
dare
you
What
said
Telyanin
But
these
words
came
like
a
piteous
despairing
cry
and
an
entreaty
for
pardon
As
soon
as
Rostov
heard
them
an
enormous
load
of
doubt
fell
from
him
He
was
glad
and
at
the
same
instant
began
to
pity
the
miserable
man
who
stood
before
him
but
the
task
he
had
begun
had
to
be
completed
Heaven
only
knows
what
the
people
here
may
imagine
muttered
Telyanin
taking
up
his
cap
and
moving
toward
a
small
empty
room
We
must
have
an
explanation
I
know
it
and
shall
prove
it
said
Rostov
I
Every
muscle
of
Telyanin
s
pale
terrified
face
began
to
quiver
his
eyes
still
shifted
from
side
to
side
but
with
a
downward
look
not
rising
to
Rostov
s
face
and
his
sobs
were
audible
Count
Don
t
ruin
a
young
fellow
here
is
this
wretched
money
take
it
He
threw
it
on
the
table
I
have
an
old
father
and
mother
Rostov
took
the
money
avoiding
Telyanin
s
eyes
and
went
out
of
the
room
without
a
word
But
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
then
retraced
his
steps
O
God
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
how
could
you
do
it
Count
said
Telyanin
drawing
nearer
to
him
Don
t
touch
me
said
Rostov
drawing
back
If
you
need
it
take
the
money
and
he
threw
the
purse
to
him
and
ran
out
of
the
inn
That
same
evening
there
was
an
animated
discussion
among
the
squadron
s
officers
in
Denisov
s
quarters
And
I
tell
you
Rostov
that
you
must
apologize
to
the
colonel
said
a
tall
grizzly
haired
staff
captain
with
enormous
mustaches
and
many
wrinkles
on
his
large
features
to
Rostov
who
was
crimson
with
excitement
The
staff
captain
Kirsten
had
twice
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
for
affairs
of
honor
and
had
twice
regained
his
commission
I
will
allow
no
one
to
call
me
a
liar
cried
Rostov
He
told
me
I
lied
and
I
told
him
he
lied
And
there
it
rests
He
may
keep
me
on
duty
every
day
or
may
place
me
under
arrest
but
no
one
can
make
me
apologize
because
if
he
as
commander
of
this
regiment
thinks
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
give
me
satisfaction
then
You
just
wait
a
moment
my
dear
fellow
and
listen
interrupted
the
staff
captain
in
his
deep
bass
calmly
stroking
his
long
mustache
You
tell
the
colonel
in
the
presence
of
other
officers
that
an
officer
has
stolen
I
m
not
to
blame
that
the
conversation
began
in
the
presence
of
other
officers
Perhaps
I
ought
not
to
have
spoken
before
them
but
I
am
not
a
diplomatist
That
s
why
I
joined
the
hussars
thinking
that
here
one
would
not
need
finesse
and
he
tells
me
that
I
am
lying
so
let
him
give
me
satisfaction
That
s
all
right
No
one
thinks
you
a
coward
but
that
s
not
the
point
Ask
Denisov
whether
it
is
not
out
of
the
question
for
a
cadet
to
demand
satisfaction
of
his
regimental
commander
Denisov
sat
gloomily
biting
his
mustache
and
listening
to
the
conversation
evidently
with
no
wish
to
take
part
in
it
He
answered
the
staff
captain
s
question
by
a
disapproving
shake
of
his
head
You
speak
to
the
colonel
about
this
nasty
business
before
other
officers
continued
the
staff
captain
and
Bogdanich
the
colonel
was
called
Bogdanich
shuts
you
up
He
did
not
shut
me
up
he
said
I
was
telling
an
untruth
Well
have
it
so
and
you
talked
a
lot
of
nonsense
to
him
and
must
apologize
Not
on
any
account
exclaimed
Rostov
I
did
not
expect
this
of
you
said
the
staff
captain
seriously
and
severely
You
don
t
wish
to
apologize
but
man
it
s
not
only
to
him
but
to
the
whole
regiment
all
of
us
you
re
to
blame
all
round
The
case
is
this
you
ought
to
have
thought
the
matter
over
and
taken
advice
but
no
you
go
and
blurt
it
all
straight
out
before
the
officers
Now
what
was
the
colonel
to
do
Have
the
officer
tried
and
disgrace
the
whole
regiment
Disgrace
the
whole
regiment
because
of
one
scoundrel
Is
that
how
you
look
at
it
We
don
t
see
it
like
that
And
Bogdanich
was
a
brick
he
told
you
you
were
saying
what
was
not
true
It
s
not
pleasant
but
what
s
to
be
done
my
dear
fellow
You
landed
yourself
in
it
And
now
when
one
wants
to
smooth
the
thing
over
some
conceit
prevents
your
apologizing
and
you
wish
to
make
the
whole
affair
public
You
are
offended
at
being
put
on
duty
a
bit
but
why
not
apologize
to
an
old
and
honorable
officer
Whatever
Bogdanich
may
be
anyway
he
is
an
honorable
and
brave
old
colonel
You
re
quick
at
taking
offense
but
you
don
t
mind
disgracing
the
whole
regiment
The
staff
captain
s
voice
began
to
tremble
You
have
been
in
the
regiment
next
to
no
time
my
lad
you
re
here
today
and
tomorrow
you
ll
be
appointed
adjutant
somewhere
and
can
snap
your
fingers
when
it
is
said
There
are
thieves
among
the
Pavlograd
officers
But
it
s
not
all
the
same
to
us
Am
I
not
right
Denisov
It
s
not
the
same
Denisov
remained
silent
and
did
not
move
but
occasionally
looked
with
his
glittering
black
eyes
at
Rostov
You
value
your
own
pride
and
don
t
wish
to
apologize
continued
the
staff
captain
but
we
old
fellows
who
have
grown
up
in
and
God
willing
are
going
to
die
in
the
regiment
we
prize
the
honor
of
the
regiment
and
Bogdanich
knows
it
Oh
we
do
prize
it
old
fellow
And
all
this
is
not
right
it
s
not
right
You
may
take
offense
or
not
but
I
always
stick
to
mother
truth
It
s
not
right
And
the
staff
captain
rose
and
turned
away
from
Rostov
That
s
twue
devil
take
it
shouted
Denisov
jumping
up
Now
then
Wostov
now
then
Rostov
growing
red
and
pale
alternately
looked
first
at
one
officer
and
then
at
the
other
No
gentlemen
no
you
mustn
t
think
I
quite
understand
You
re
wrong
to
think
that
of
me
I
for
me
for
the
honor
of
the
regiment
I
d
Ah
well
I
ll
show
that
in
action
and
for
me
the
honor
of
the
flag
Well
never
mind
it
s
true
I
m
to
blame
to
blame
all
round
Well
what
else
do
you
want
Come
that
s
right
Count
cried
the
staff
captain
turning
round
and
clapping
Rostov
on
the
shoulder
with
his
big
hand
I
tell
you
shouted
Denisov
he
s
a
fine
fellow
That
s
better
Count
said
the
staff
captain
beginning
to
address
Rostov
by
his
title
as
if
in
recognition
of
his
confession
Go
and
apologize
your
excellency
Yes
go
Gentlemen
I
ll
do
anything
No
one
shall
hear
a
word
from
me
said
Rostov
in
an
imploring
voice
but
I
can
t
apologize
by
God
I
can
t
do
what
you
will
How
can
I
go
and
apologize
like
a
little
boy
asking
forgiveness
Denisov
began
to
laugh
It
ll
be
worse
for
you
Bogdanich
is
vindictive
and
you
ll
pay
for
your
obstinacy
said
Kirsten
No
on
my
word
it
s
not
obstinacy
I
can
t
describe
the
feeling
I
can
t
Well
it
s
as
you
like
said
the
staff
captain
And
what
has
become
of
that
scoundrel
he
asked
Denisov
He
has
weported
himself
sick
he
s
to
be
stwuck
off
the
list
tomowwow
muttered
Denisov
It
is
an
illness
there
s
no
other
way
of
explaining
it
said
the
staff
captain
Illness
or
not
he
d
better
not
cwoss
my
path
I
d
kill
him
shouted
Denisov
in
a
bloodthirsty
tone
Just
then
Zherkov
entered
the
room
What
brings
you
here
cried
the
officers
turning
to
the
newcomer
We
re
to
go
into
action
gentlemen
Mack
has
surrendered
with
his
whole
army
It
s
not
true
I
ve
seen
him
myself
What
Saw
the
real
Mack
With
hands
and
feet
Into
action
Into
action
Bring
him
a
bottle
for
such
news
But
how
did
you
come
here
I
ve
been
sent
back
to
the
regiment
all
on
account
of
that
devil
Mack
An
Austrian
general
complained
of
me
I
congratulated
him
on
Mack
s
arrival
What
s
the
matter
Rostov
You
look
as
if
you
d
just
come
out
of
a
hot
bath
Oh
my
dear
fellow
we
re
in
such
a
stew
here
these
last
two
days
The
regimental
adjutant
came
in
and
confirmed
the
news
brought
by
Zherkov
They
were
under
orders
to
advance
next
day
We
re
going
into
action
gentlemen
Well
thank
God
We
ve
been
sitting
here
too
long
Kutuzov
fell
back
toward
Vienna
destroying
behind
him
the
bridges
over
the
rivers
Inn
at
Braunau
and
Traun
near
Linz
On
October
the
Russian
troops
were
crossing
the
river
Enns
At
midday
the
Russian
baggage
train
the
artillery
and
columns
of
troops
were
defiling
through
the
town
of
Enns
on
both
sides
of
the
bridge
It
was
a
warm
rainy
autumnal
day
The
wide
expanse
that
opened
out
before
the
heights
on
which
the
Russian
batteries
stood
guarding
the
bridge
was
at
times
veiled
by
a
diaphanous
curtain
of
slanting
rain
and
then
suddenly
spread
out
in
the
sunlight
far
distant
objects
could
be
clearly
seen
glittering
as
though
freshly
varnished
Down
below
the
little
town
could
be
seen
with
its
white
red
roofed
houses
its
cathedral
and
its
bridge
on
both
sides
of
which
streamed
jostling
masses
of
Russian
troops
At
the
bend
of
the
Danube
vessels
an
island
and
a
castle
with
a
park
surrounded
by
the
waters
of
the
confluence
of
the
Enns
and
the
Danube
became
visible
and
the
rocky
left
bank
of
the
Danube
covered
with
pine
forests
with
a
mystic
background
of
green
treetops
and
bluish
gorges
The
turrets
of
a
convent
stood
out
beyond
a
wild
virgin
pine
forest
and
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
Enns
the
enemy
s
horse
patrols
could
be
discerned
Among
the
field
guns
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
general
in
command
of
the
rearguard
stood
with
a
staff
officer
scanning
the
country
through
his
fieldglass
A
little
behind
them
Nesvitski
who
had
been
sent
to
the
rearguard
by
the
commander
in
chief
was
sitting
on
the
trail
of
a
gun
carriage
A
Cossack
who
accompanied
him
had
handed
him
a
knapsack
and
a
flask
and
Nesvitski
was
treating
some
officers
to
pies
and
real
doppelkummel
The
officers
gladly
gathered
round
him
some
on
their
knees
some
squatting
Turkish
fashion
on
the
wet
grass
Yes
the
Austrian
prince
who
built
that
castle
was
no
fool
It
s
a
fine
place
Why
are
you
not
eating
anything
gentlemen
Nesvitski
was
saying
Thank
you
very
much
Prince
answered
one
of
the
officers
pleased
to
be
talking
to
a
staff
officer
of
such
importance
It
s
a
lovely
place
We
passed
close
to
the
park
and
saw
two
deer
and
what
a
splendid
house
Look
Prince
said
another
who
would
have
dearly
liked
to
take
another
pie
but
felt
shy
and
therefore
pretended
to
be
examining
the
countryside
See
our
infantrymen
have
already
got
there
Look
there
in
the
meadow
behind
the
village
three
of
them
are
dragging
something
They
ll
ransack
that
castle
he
remarked
with
evident
approval
So
they
will
said
Nesvitski
No
but
what
I
should
like
added
he
munching
a
pie
in
his
moist
lipped
handsome
mouth
would
be
to
slip
in
over
there
He
pointed
with
a
smile
to
a
turreted
nunnery
and
his
eyes
narrowed
and
gleamed
That
would
be
fine
gentlemen
The
officers
laughed
Just
to
flutter
the
nuns
a
bit
They
say
there
are
Italian
girls
among
them
On
my
word
I
d
give
five
years
of
my
life
for
it
They
must
be
feeling
dull
too
said
one
of
the
bolder
officers
laughing
Meanwhile
the
staff
officer
standing
in
front
pointed
out
something
to
the
general
who
looked
through
his
field
glass
Yes
so
it
is
so
it
is
said
the
general
angrily
lowering
the
field
glass
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
so
it
is
They
ll
be
fired
on
at
the
crossing
And
why
are
they
dawdling
there
On
the
opposite
side
the
enemy
could
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
and
from
their
battery
a
milk
white
cloud
arose
Then
came
the
distant
report
of
a
shot
and
our
troops
could
be
seen
hurrying
to
the
crossing
Nesvitski
rose
puffing
and
went
up
to
the
general
smiling
Would
not
your
excellency
like
a
little
refreshment
he
said
It
s
a
bad
business
said
the
general
without
answering
him
our
men
have
been
wasting
time
Hadn
t
I
better
ride
over
your
excellency
asked
Nesvitski
Yes
please
do
answered
the
general
and
he
repeated
the
order
that
had
already
once
been
given
in
detail
and
tell
the
hussars
that
they
are
to
cross
last
and
to
fire
the
bridge
as
I
ordered
and
the
inflammable
material
on
the
bridge
must
be
reinspected
Very
good
answered
Nesvitski
He
called
the
Cossack
with
his
horse
told
him
to
put
away
the
knapsack
and
flask
and
swung
his
heavy
person
easily
into
the
saddle
I
ll
really
call
in
on
the
nuns
he
said
to
the
officers
who
watched
him
smilingly
and
he
rode
off
by
the
winding
path
down
the
hill
Now
then
let
s
see
how
far
it
will
carry
Captain
Just
try
said
the
general
turning
to
an
artillery
officer
Have
a
little
fun
to
pass
the
time
Crew
to
your
guns
commanded
the
officer
In
a
moment
the
men
came
running
gaily
from
their
campfires
and
began
loading
One
came
the
command
Number
one
jumped
briskly
aside
The
gun
rang
out
with
a
deafening
metallic
roar
and
a
whistling
grenade
flew
above
the
heads
of
our
troops
below
the
hill
and
fell
far
short
of
the
enemy
a
little
smoke
showing
the
spot
where
it
burst
The
faces
of
officers
and
men
brightened
up
at
the
sound
Everyone
got
up
and
began
watching
the
movements
of
our
troops
below
as
plainly
visible
as
if
but
a
stone
s
throw
away
and
the
movements
of
the
approaching
enemy
farther
off
At
the
same
instant
the
sun
came
fully
out
from
behind
the
clouds
and
the
clear
sound
of
the
solitary
shot
and
the
brilliance
of
the
bright
sunshine
merged
in
a
single
joyous
and
spirited
impression
Two
of
the
enemy
s
shots
had
already
flown
across
the
bridge
where
there
was
a
crush
Halfway
across
stood
Prince
Nesvitski
who
had
alighted
from
his
horse
and
whose
big
body
was
jammed
against
the
railings
He
looked
back
laughing
to
the
Cossack
who
stood
a
few
steps
behind
him
holding
two
horses
by
their
bridles
Each
time
Prince
Nesvitski
tried
to
move
on
soldiers
and
carts
pushed
him
back
again
and
pressed
him
against
the
railings
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
smile
What
a
fine
fellow
you
are
friend
said
the
Cossack
to
a
convoy
soldier
with
a
wagon
who
was
pressing
onto
the
infantrymen
who
were
crowded
together
close
to
his
wheels
and
his
horses
What
a
fellow
You
can
t
wait
a
moment
Don
t
you
see
the
general
wants
to
pass
But
the
convoyman
took
no
notice
of
the
word
general
and
shouted
at
the
soldiers
who
were
blocking
his
way
Hi
there
boys
Keep
to
the
left
Wait
a
bit
But
the
soldiers
crowded
together
shoulder
to
shoulder
their
bayonets
interlocking
moved
over
the
bridge
in
a
dense
mass
Looking
down
over
the
rails
Prince
Nesvitski
saw
the
rapid
noisy
little
waves
of
the
Enns
which
rippling
and
eddying
round
the
piles
of
the
bridge
chased
each
other
along
Looking
on
the
bridge
he
saw
equally
uniform
living
waves
of
soldiers
shoulder
straps
covered
shakos
knapsacks
bayonets
long
muskets
and
under
the
shakos
faces
with
broad
cheekbones
sunken
cheeks
and
listless
tired
expressions
and
feet
that
moved
through
the
sticky
mud
that
covered
the
planks
of
the
bridge
Sometimes
through
the
monotonous
waves
of
men
like
a
fleck
of
white
foam
on
the
waves
of
the
Enns
an
officer
in
a
cloak
and
with
a
type
of
face
different
from
that
of
the
men
squeezed
his
way
along
sometimes
like
a
chip
of
wood
whirling
in
the
river
an
hussar
on
foot
an
orderly
or
a
townsman
was
carried
through
the
waves
of
infantry
and
sometimes
like
a
log
floating
down
the
river
an
officers
or
company
s
baggage
wagon
piled
high
leather
covered
and
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
moved
across
the
bridge
It
s
as
if
a
dam
had
burst
said
the
Cossack
hopelessly
Are
there
many
more
of
you
to
come
A
million
all
but
one
replied
a
waggish
soldier
in
a
torn
coat
with
a
wink
and
passed
on
followed
by
another
an
old
man
If
he
he
meant
the
enemy
begins
popping
at
the
bridge
now
said
the
old
soldier
dismally
to
a
comrade
you
ll
forget
to
scratch
yourself
That
soldier
passed
on
and
after
him
came
another
sitting
on
a
cart
Where
the
devil
have
the
leg
bands
been
shoved
to
said
an
orderly
running
behind
the
cart
and
fumbling
in
the
back
of
it
And
he
also
passed
on
with
the
wagon
Then
came
some
merry
soldiers
who
had
evidently
been
drinking
And
then
old
fellow
he
gives
him
one
in
the
teeth
with
the
butt
end
of
his
gun
a
soldier
whose
greatcoat
was
well
tucked
up
said
gaily
with
a
wide
swing
of
his
arm
Yes
the
ham
was
just
delicious
answered
another
with
a
loud
laugh
And
they
too
passed
on
so
that
Nesvitski
did
not
learn
who
had
been
struck
on
the
teeth
or
what
the
ham
had
to
do
with
it
Bah
How
they
scurry
He
just
sends
a
ball
and
they
think
they
ll
all
be
killed
a
sergeant
was
saying
angrily
and
reproachfully
As
it
flies
past
me
Daddy
the
ball
I
mean
said
a
young
soldier
with
an
enormous
mouth
hardly
refraining
from
laughing
I
felt
like
dying
of
fright
I
did
pon
my
word
I
got
that
frightened
said
he
as
if
bragging
of
having
been
frightened
That
one
also
passed
Then
followed
a
cart
unlike
any
that
had
gone
before
It
was
a
German
cart
with
a
pair
of
horses
led
by
a
German
and
seemed
loaded
with
a
whole
houseful
of
effects
A
fine
brindled
cow
with
a
large
udder
was
attached
to
the
cart
behind
A
woman
with
an
unweaned
baby
an
old
woman
and
a
healthy
German
girl
with
bright
red
cheeks
were
sitting
on
some
feather
beds
Evidently
these
fugitives
were
allowed
to
pass
by
special
permission
The
eyes
of
all
the
soldiers
turned
toward
the
women
and
while
the
vehicle
was
passing
at
foot
pace
all
the
soldiers
remarks
related
to
the
two
young
ones
Every
face
bore
almost
the
same
smile
expressing
unseemly
thoughts
about
the
women
Just
see
the
German
sausage
is
making
tracks
too
Sell
me
the
missis
said
another
soldier
addressing
the
German
who
angry
and
frightened
strode
energetically
along
with
downcast
eyes
See
how
smart
she
s
made
herself
Oh
the
devils
There
Fedotov
you
should
be
quartered
on
them
I
have
seen
as
much
before
now
mate
Where
are
you
going
asked
an
infantry
officer
who
was
eating
an
apple
also
half
smiling
as
he
looked
at
the
handsome
girl
The
German
closed
his
eyes
signifying
that
he
did
not
understand
Take
it
if
you
like
said
the
officer
giving
the
girl
an
apple
The
girl
smiled
and
took
it
Nesvitski
like
the
rest
of
the
men
on
the
bridge
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
women
till
they
had
passed
When
they
had
gone
by
the
same
stream
of
soldiers
followed
with
the
same
kind
of
talk
and
at
last
all
stopped
As
often
happens
the
horses
of
a
convoy
wagon
became
restive
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
and
the
whole
crowd
had
to
wait
And
why
are
they
stopping
There
s
no
proper
order
said
the
soldiers
Where
are
you
shoving
to
Devil
take
you
Can
t
you
wait
It
ll
be
worse
if
he
fires
the
bridge
See
here
s
an
officer
jammed
in
too
different
voices
were
saying
in
the
crowd
as
the
men
looked
at
one
another
and
all
pressed
toward
the
exit
from
the
bridge
Looking
down
at
the
waters
of
the
Enns
under
the
bridge
Nesvitski
suddenly
heard
a
sound
new
to
him
of
something
swiftly
approaching
something
big
that
splashed
into
the
water
Just
see
where
it
carries
to
a
soldier
near
by
said
sternly
looking
round
at
the
sound
Encouraging
us
to
get
along
quicker
said
another
uneasily
The
crowd
moved
on
again
Nesvitski
realized
that
it
was
a
cannon
ball
Hey
Cossack
my
horse
he
said
Now
then
you
there
get
out
of
the
way
Make
way
With
great
difficulty
he
managed
to
get
to
his
horse
and
shouting
continually
he
moved
on
The
soldiers
squeezed
themselves
to
make
way
for
him
but
again
pressed
on
him
so
that
they
jammed
his
leg
and
those
nearest
him
were
not
to
blame
for
they
were
themselves
pressed
still
harder
from
behind
Nesvitski
Nesvitski
you
numskull
came
a
hoarse
voice
from
behind
him
Nesvitski
looked
round
and
saw
some
fifteen
paces
away
but
separated
by
the
living
mass
of
moving
infantry
Vaska
Denisov
red
and
shaggy
with
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
black
head
and
a
cloak
hanging
jauntily
over
his
shoulder
Tell
these
devils
these
fiends
to
let
me
pass
shouted
Denisov
evidently
in
a
fit
of
rage
his
coal
black
eyes
with
their
bloodshot
whites
glittering
and
rolling
as
he
waved
his
sheathed
saber
in
a
small
bare
hand
as
red
as
his
face
Ah
Vaska
joyfully
replied
Nesvitski
What
s
up
with
you
The
squadwon
can
t
pass
shouted
Vaska
Denisov
showing
his
white
teeth
fiercely
and
spurring
his
black
thoroughbred
Arab
which
twitched
its
ears
as
the
bayonets
touched
it
and
snorted
spurting
white
foam
from
his
bit
tramping
the
planks
of
the
bridge
with
his
hoofs
and
apparently
ready
to
jump
over
the
railings
had
his
rider
let
him
What
is
this
They
re
like
sheep
Just
like
sheep
Out
of
the
way
Let
us
pass
Stop
there
you
devil
with
the
cart
I
ll
hack
you
with
my
saber
he
shouted
actually
drawing
his
saber
from
its
scabbard
and
flourishing
it
The
soldiers
crowded
against
one
another
with
terrified
faces
and
Denisov
joined
Nesvitski
How
s
it
you
re
not
drunk
today
said
Nesvitski
when
the
other
had
ridden
up
to
him
They
don
t
even
give
one
time
to
dwink
answered
Vaska
Denisov
They
keep
dwagging
the
wegiment
to
and
fwo
all
day
If
they
mean
to
fight
let
s
fight
But
the
devil
knows
what
this
is
What
a
dandy
you
are
today
said
Nesvitski
looking
at
Denisov
s
new
cloak
and
saddlecloth
Denisov
smiled
took
out
of
his
sabretache
a
handkerchief
that
diffused
a
smell
of
perfume
and
put
it
to
Nesvitski
s
nose
Of
course
I
m
going
into
action
I
ve
shaved
bwushed
my
teeth
and
scented
myself
The
imposing
figure
of
Nesvitski
followed
by
his
Cossack
and
the
determination
of
Denisov
who
flourished
his
sword
and
shouted
frantically
had
such
an
effect
that
they
managed
to
squeeze
through
to
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
and
stopped
the
infantry
Beside
the
bridge
Nesvitski
found
the
colonel
to
whom
he
had
to
deliver
the
order
and
having
done
this
he
rode
back
Having
cleared
the
way
Denisov
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
Carelessly
holding
in
his
stallion
that
was
neighing
and
pawing
the
ground
eager
to
rejoin
its
fellows
he
watched
his
squadron
draw
nearer
Then
the
clang
of
hoofs
as
of
several
horses
galloping
resounded
on
the
planks
of
the
bridge
and
the
squadron
officers
in
front
and
men
four
abreast
spread
across
the
bridge
and
began
to
emerge
on
his
side
of
it
The
infantry
who
had
been
stopped
crowded
near
the
bridge
in
the
trampled
mud
and
gazed
with
that
particular
feeling
of
ill
will
estrangement
and
ridicule
with
which
troops
of
different
arms
usually
encounter
one
another
at
the
clean
smart
hussars
who
moved
past
them
in
regular
order
Smart
lads
Only
fit
for
a
fair
said
one
What
good
are
they
They
re
led
about
just
for
show
remarked
another
Don
t
kick
up
the
dust
you
infantry
jested
an
hussar
whose
prancing
horse
had
splashed
mud
over
some
foot
soldiers
I
d
like
to
put
you
on
a
two
days
march
with
a
knapsack
Your
fine
cords
would
soon
get
a
bit
rubbed
said
an
infantryman
wiping
the
mud
off
his
face
with
his
sleeve
Perched
up
there
you
re
more
like
a
bird
than
a
man
There
now
Zikin
they
ought
to
put
you
on
a
horse
You
d
look
fine
said
a
corporal
chaffing
a
thin
little
soldier
who
bent
under
the
weight
of
his
knapsack
Take
a
stick
between
your
legs
that
ll
suit
you
for
a
horse
the
hussar
shouted
back
The
last
of
the
infantry
hurriedly
crossed
the
bridge
squeezing
together
as
they
approached
it
as
if
passing
through
a
funnel
At
last
the
baggage
wagons
had
all
crossed
the
crush
was
less
and
the
last
battalion
came
onto
the
bridge
Only
Denisov
s
squadron
of
hussars
remained
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
facing
the
enemy
who
could
be
seen
from
the
hill
on
the
opposite
bank
but
was
not
yet
visible
from
the
bridge
for
the
horizon
as
seen
from
the
valley
through
which
the
river
flowed
was
formed
by
the
rising
ground
only
half
a
mile
away
At
the
foot
of
the
hill
lay
wasteland
over
which
a
few
groups
of
our
Cossack
scouts
were
moving
Suddenly
on
the
road
at
the
top
of
the
high
ground
artillery
and
troops
in
blue
uniform
were
seen
These
were
the
French
A
group
of
Cossack
scouts
retired
down
the
hill
at
a
trot
All
the
officers
and
men
of
Denisov
s
squadron
though
they
tried
to
talk
of
other
things
and
to
look
in
other
directions
thought
only
of
what
was
there
on
the
hilltop
and
kept
constantly
looking
at
the
patches
appearing
on
the
skyline
which
they
knew
to
be
the
enemy
s
troops
The
weather
had
cleared
again
since
noon
and
the
sun
was
descending
brightly
upon
the
Danube
and
the
dark
hills
around
it
It
was
calm
and
at
intervals
the
bugle
calls
and
the
shouts
of
the
enemy
could
be
heard
from
the
hill
There
was
no
one
now
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
except
a
few
scattered
skirmishers
An
empty
space
of
some
seven
hundred
yards
was
all
that
separated
them
The
enemy
ceased
firing
and
that
stern
threatening
inaccessible
and
intangible
line
which
separates
two
hostile
armies
was
all
the
more
clearly
felt
One
step
beyond
that
boundary
line
which
resembles
the
line
dividing
the
living
from
the
dead
lies
uncertainty
suffering
and
death
And
what
is
there
Who
is
there
there
beyond
that
field
that
tree
that
roof
lit
up
by
the
sun
No
one
knows
but
one
wants
to
know
You
fear
and
yet
long
to
cross
that
line
and
know
that
sooner
or
later
it
must
be
crossed
and
you
will
have
to
find
out
what
is
there
just
as
you
will
inevitably
have
to
learn
what
lies
the
other
side
of
death
But
you
are
strong
healthy
cheerful
and
excited
and
are
surrounded
by
other
such
excitedly
animated
and
healthy
men
So
thinks
or
at
any
rate
feels
anyone
who
comes
in
sight
of
the
enemy
and
that
feeling
gives
a
particular
glamour
and
glad
keenness
of
impression
to
everything
that
takes
place
at
such
moments
On
the
high
ground
where
the
enemy
was
the
smoke
of
a
cannon
rose
and
a
ball
flew
whistling
over
the
heads
of
the
hussar
squadron
The
officers
who
had
been
standing
together
rode
off
to
their
places
The
hussars
began
carefully
aligning
their
horses
Silence
fell
on
the
whole
squadron
All
were
looking
at
the
enemy
in
front
and
at
the
squadron
commander
awaiting
the
word
of
command
A
second
and
a
third
cannon
ball
flew
past
Evidently
they
were
firing
at
the
hussars
but
the
balls
with
rapid
rhythmic
whistle
flew
over
the
heads
of
the
horsemen
and
fell
somewhere
beyond
them
The
hussars
did
not
look
round
but
at
the
sound
of
each
shot
as
at
the
word
of
command
the
whole
squadron
with
its
rows
of
faces
so
alike
yet
so
different
holding
its
breath
while
the
ball
flew
past
rose
in
the
stirrups
and
sank
back
again
The
soldiers
without
turning
their
heads
glanced
at
one
another
curious
to
see
their
comrades
impression
Every
face
from
Denisov
s
to
that
of
the
bugler
showed
one
common
expression
of
conflict
irritation
and
excitement
around
chin
and
mouth
The
quartermaster
frowned
looking
at
the
soldiers
as
if
threatening
to
punish
them
Cadet
Mironov
ducked
every
time
a
ball
flew
past
Rostov
on
the
left
flank
mounted
on
his
Rook
a
handsome
horse
despite
its
game
leg
had
the
happy
air
of
a
schoolboy
called
up
before
a
large
audience
for
an
examination
in
which
he
feels
sure
he
will
distinguish
himself
He
was
glancing
at
everyone
with
a
clear
bright
expression
as
if
asking
them
to
notice
how
calmly
he
sat
under
fire
But
despite
himself
on
his
face
too
that
same
indication
of
something
new
and
stern
showed
round
the
mouth
Who
s
that
curtseying
there
Cadet
Miwonov
That
s
not
wight
Look
at
me
cried
Denisov
who
unable
to
keep
still
on
one
spot
kept
turning
his
horse
in
front
of
the
squadron
The
black
hairy
snub
nosed
face
of
Vaska
Denisov
and
his
whole
short
sturdy
figure
with
the
sinewy
hairy
hand
and
stumpy
fingers
in
which
he
held
the
hilt
of
his
naked
saber
looked
just
as
it
usually
did
especially
toward
evening
when
he
had
emptied
his
second
bottle
he
was
only
redder
than
usual
With
his
shaggy
head
thrown
back
like
birds
when
they
drink
pressing
his
spurs
mercilessly
into
the
sides
of
his
good
horse
Bedouin
and
sitting
as
though
falling
backwards
in
the
saddle
he
galloped
to
the
other
flank
of
the
squadron
and
shouted
in
a
hoarse
voice
to
the
men
to
look
to
their
pistols
He
rode
up
to
Kirsten
The
staff
captain
on
his
broad
backed
steady
mare
came
at
a
walk
to
meet
him
His
face
with
its
long
mustache
was
serious
as
always
only
his
eyes
were
brighter
than
usual
Well
what
about
it
said
he
to
Denisov
It
won
t
come
to
a
fight
You
ll
see
we
shall
retire
The
devil
only
knows
what
they
re
about
muttered
Denisov
Ah
Wostov
he
cried
noticing
the
cadet
s
bright
face
you
ve
got
it
at
last
And
he
smiled
approvingly
evidently
pleased
with
the
cadet
Rostov
felt
perfectly
happy
Just
then
the
commander
appeared
on
the
bridge
Denisov
galloped
up
to
him
Your
excellency
Let
us
attack
them
I
ll
dwive
them
off
Attack
indeed
said
the
colonel
in
a
bored
voice
puckering
up
his
face
as
if
driving
off
a
troublesome
fly
And
why
are
you
stopping
here
Don
t
you
see
the
skirmishers
are
retreating
Lead
the
squadron
back
The
squadron
crossed
the
bridge
and
drew
out
of
range
of
fire
without
having
lost
a
single
man
The
second
squadron
that
had
been
in
the
front
line
followed
them
across
and
the
last
Cossacks
quitted
the
farther
side
of
the
river
The
two
Pavlograd
squadrons
having
crossed
the
bridge
retired
up
the
hill
one
after
the
other
Their
colonel
Karl
Bogdanich
Schubert
came
up
to
Denisov
s
squadron
and
rode
at
a
footpace
not
far
from
Rostov
without
taking
any
notice
of
him
although
they
were
now
meeting
for
the
first
time
since
their
encounter
concerning
Telyanin
Rostov
feeling
that
he
was
at
the
front
and
in
the
power
of
a
man
toward
whom
he
now
admitted
that
he
had
been
to
blame
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
the
colonel
s
athletic
back
his
nape
covered
with
light
hair
and
his
red
neck
It
seemed
to
Rostov
that
Bogdanich
was
only
pretending
not
to
notice
him
and
that
his
whole
aim
now
was
to
test
the
cadet
s
courage
so
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
around
him
merrily
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
Bogdanich
rode
so
near
in
order
to
show
him
his
courage
Next
he
thought
that
his
enemy
would
send
the
squadron
on
a
desperate
attack
just
to
punish
him
Rostov
Then
he
imagined
how
after
the
attack
Bogdanich
would
come
up
to
him
as
he
lay
wounded
and
would
magnanimously
extend
the
hand
of
reconciliation
The
high
shouldered
figure
of
Zherkov
familiar
to
the
Pavlograds
as
he
had
but
recently
left
their
regiment
rode
up
to
the
colonel
After
his
dismissal
from
headquarters
Zherkov
had
not
remained
in
the
regiment
saying
he
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
slave
at
the
front
when
he
could
get
more
rewards
by
doing
nothing
on
the
staff
and
had
succeeded
in
attaching
himself
as
an
orderly
officer
to
Prince
Bagration
He
now
came
to
his
former
chief
with
an
order
from
the
commander
of
the
rear
guard
Colonel
he
said
addressing
Rostov
s
enemy
with
an
air
of
gloomy
gravity
and
glancing
round
at
his
comrades
there
is
an
order
to
stop
and
fire
the
bridge
An
order
to
who
asked
the
colonel
morosely
I
don
t
myself
know
to
who
replied
the
cornet
in
a
serious
tone
but
the
prince
told
me
to
go
and
tell
the
colonel
that
the
hussars
must
return
quickly
and
fire
the
bridge
Zherkov
was
followed
by
an
officer
of
the
suite
who
rode
up
to
the
colonel
of
hussars
with
the
same
order
After
him
the
stout
Nesvitski
came
galloping
up
on
a
Cossack
horse
that
could
scarcely
carry
his
weight
How
s
this
Colonel
he
shouted
as
he
approached
I
told
you
to
fire
the
bridge
and
now
someone
has
gone
and
blundered
they
are
all
beside
themselves
over
there
and
one
can
t
make
anything
out
The
colonel
deliberately
stopped
the
regiment
and
turned
to
Nesvitski
You
spoke
to
me
of
inflammable
material
said
he
but
you
said
nothing
about
firing
it
But
my
dear
sir
said
Nesvitski
as
he
drew
up
taking
off
his
cap
and
smoothing
his
hair
wet
with
perspiration
with
his
plump
hand
wasn
t
I
telling
you
to
fire
the
bridge
when
inflammable
material
had
been
put
in
position
I
am
not
your
dear
sir
Mr
Staff
Officer
and
you
did
not
tell
me
to
burn
the
bridge
I
know
the
service
and
it
is
my
habit
orders
strictly
to
obey
You
said
the
bridge
would
be
burned
but
who
would
it
burn
I
could
not
know
by
the
holy
spirit
Ah
that
s
always
the
way
said
Nesvitski
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
How
did
you
get
here
said
he
turning
to
Zherkov
On
the
same
business
But
you
are
damp
Let
me
wring
you
out
You
were
saying
Mr
Staff
Officer
continued
the
colonel
in
an
offended
tone
Colonel
interrupted
the
officer
of
the
suite
You
must
be
quick
or
the
enemy
will
bring
up
his
guns
to
use
grapeshot
The
colonel
looked
silently
at
the
officer
of
the
suite
at
the
stout
staff
officer
and
at
Zherkov
and
he
frowned
I
will
the
bridge
fire
he
said
in
a
solemn
tone
as
if
to
announce
that
in
spite
of
all
the
unpleasantness
he
had
to
endure
he
would
still
do
the
right
thing
Striking
his
horse
with
his
long
muscular
legs
as
if
it
were
to
blame
for
everything
the
colonel
moved
forward
and
ordered
the
second
squadron
that
in
which
Rostov
was
serving
under
Denisov
to
return
to
the
bridge
There
it
s
just
as
I
thought
said
Rostov
to
himself
He
wishes
to
test
me
His
heart
contracted
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
Let
him
see
whether
I
am
a
coward
he
thought
Again
on
all
the
bright
faces
of
the
squadron
the
serious
expression
appeared
that
they
had
worn
when
under
fire
Rostov
watched
his
enemy
the
colonel
closely
to
find
in
his
face
confirmation
of
his
own
conjecture
but
the
colonel
did
not
once
glance
at
Rostov
and
looked
as
he
always
did
when
at
the
front
solemn
and
stern
Then
came
the
word
of
command
Look
sharp
Look
sharp
several
voices
repeated
around
him
Their
sabers
catching
in
the
bridles
and
their
spurs
jingling
the
hussars
hastily
dismounted
not
knowing
what
they
were
to
do
The
men
were
crossing
themselves
Rostov
no
longer
looked
at
the
colonel
he
had
no
time
He
was
afraid
of
falling
behind
the
hussars
so
much
afraid
that
his
heart
stood
still
His
hand
trembled
as
he
gave
his
horse
into
an
orderly
s
charge
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
with
a
thud
Denisov
rode
past
him
leaning
back
and
shouting
something
Rostov
saw
nothing
but
the
hussars
running
all
around
him
their
spurs
catching
and
their
sabers
clattering
Stretchers
shouted
someone
behind
him
Rostov
did
not
think
what
this
call
for
stretchers
meant
he
ran
on
trying
only
to
be
ahead
of
the
others
but
just
at
the
bridge
not
looking
at
the
ground
he
came
on
some
sticky
trodden
mud
stumbled
and
fell
on
his
hands
The
others
outstripped
him
At
boss
zides
Captain
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
colonel
who
having
ridden
ahead
had
pulled
up
his
horse
near
the
bridge
with
a
triumphant
cheerful
face
Rostov
wiping
his
muddy
hands
on
his
breeches
looked
at
his
enemy
and
was
about
to
run
on
thinking
that
the
farther
he
went
to
the
front
the
better
But
Bogdanich
without
looking
at
or
recognizing
Rostov
shouted
to
him
Who
s
that
running
on
the
middle
of
the
bridge
To
the
right
Come
back
Cadet
he
cried
angrily
and
turning
to
Denisov
who
showing
off
his
courage
had
ridden
on
to
the
planks
of
the
bridge
Why
run
risks
Captain
You
should
dismount
he
said
Oh
every
bullet
has
its
billet
answered
Vaska
Denisov
turning
in
his
saddle
Meanwhile
Nesvitski
Zherkov
and
the
officer
of
the
suite
were
standing
together
out
of
range
of
the
shots
watching
now
the
small
group
of
men
with
yellow
shakos
dark
green
jackets
braided
with
cord
and
blue
riding
breeches
who
were
swarming
near
the
bridge
and
then
at
what
was
approaching
in
the
distance
from
the
opposite
side
the
blue
uniforms
and
groups
with
horses
easily
recognizable
as
artillery
Will
they
burn
the
bridge
or
not
Who
ll
get
there
first
Will
they
get
there
and
fire
the
bridge
or
will
the
French
get
within
grapeshot
range
and
wipe
them
out
These
were
the
questions
each
man
of
the
troops
on
the
high
ground
above
the
bridge
involuntarily
asked
himself
with
a
sinking
heart
watching
the
bridge
and
the
hussars
in
the
bright
evening
light
and
the
blue
tunics
advancing
from
the
other
side
with
their
bayonets
and
guns
Ugh
The
hussars
will
get
it
hot
said
Nesvitski
they
are
within
grapeshot
range
now
He
shouldn
t
have
taken
so
many
men
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
True
enough
answered
Nesvitski
two
smart
fellows
could
have
done
the
job
just
as
well
Ah
your
excellency
put
in
Zherkov
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
hussars
but
still
with
that
naive
air
that
made
it
impossible
to
know
whether
he
was
speaking
in
jest
or
in
earnest
Ah
your
excellency
How
you
look
at
things
Send
two
men
And
who
then
would
give
us
the
Vladimir
medal
and
ribbon
But
now
even
if
they
do
get
peppered
the
squadron
may
be
recommended
for
honors
and
he
may
get
a
ribbon
Our
Bogdanich
knows
how
things
are
done
There
now
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
that
s
grapeshot
He
pointed
to
the
French
guns
the
limbers
of
which
were
being
detached
and
hurriedly
removed
On
the
French
side
amid
the
groups
with
cannon
a
cloud
of
smoke
appeared
then
a
second
and
a
third
almost
simultaneously
and
at
the
moment
when
the
first
report
was
heard
a
fourth
was
seen
Then
two
reports
one
after
another
and
a
third
Oh
Oh
groaned
Nesvitski
as
if
in
fierce
pain
seizing
the
officer
of
the
suite
by
the
arm
Look
A
man
has
fallen
Fallen
fallen
Two
I
think
If
I
were
Tsar
I
would
never
go
to
war
said
Nesvitski
turning
away
The
French
guns
were
hastily
reloaded
The
infantry
in
their
blue
uniforms
advanced
toward
the
bridge
at
a
run
Smoke
appeared
again
but
at
irregular
intervals
and
grapeshot
cracked
and
rattled
onto
the
bridge
But
this
time
Nesvitski
could
not
see
what
was
happening
there
as
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
arose
from
it
The
hussars
had
succeeded
in
setting
it
on
fire
and
the
French
batteries
were
now
firing
at
them
no
longer
to
hinder
them
but
because
the
guns
were
trained
and
there
was
someone
to
fire
at
The
French
had
time
to
fire
three
rounds
of
grapeshot
before
the
hussars
got
back
to
their
horses
Two
were
misdirected
and
the
shot
went
too
high
but
the
last
round
fell
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
hussars
and
knocked
three
of
them
over
Rostov
absorbed
by
his
relations
with
Bogdanich
had
paused
on
the
bridge
not
knowing
what
to
do
There
was
no
one
to
hew
down
as
he
had
always
imagined
battles
to
himself
nor
could
he
help
to
fire
the
bridge
because
he
had
not
brought
any
burning
straw
with
him
like
the
other
soldiers
He
stood
looking
about
him
when
suddenly
he
heard
a
rattle
on
the
bridge
as
if
nuts
were
being
spilt
and
the
hussar
nearest
to
him
fell
against
the
rails
with
a
groan
Rostov
ran
up
to
him
with
the
others
Again
someone
shouted
Stretchers
Four
men
seized
the
hussar
and
began
lifting
him
Oooh
For
Christ
s
sake
let
me
alone
cried
the
wounded
man
but
still
he
was
lifted
and
laid
on
the
stretcher
Nicholas
Rostov
turned
away
and
as
if
searching
for
something
gazed
into
the
distance
at
the
waters
of
the
Danube
at
the
sky
and
at
the
sun
How
beautiful
the
sky
looked
how
blue
how
calm
and
how
deep
How
bright
and
glorious
was
the
setting
sun
With
what
soft
glitter
the
waters
of
the
distant
Danube
shone
And
fairer
still
were
the
faraway
blue
mountains
beyond
the
river
the
nunnery
the
mysterious
gorges
and
the
pine
forests
veiled
in
the
mist
of
their
summits
There
was
peace
and
happiness
I
should
wish
for
nothing
else
nothing
if
only
I
were
there
thought
Rostov
In
myself
alone
and
in
that
sunshine
there
is
so
much
happiness
but
here
groans
suffering
fear
and
this
uncertainty
and
hurry
There
they
are
shouting
again
and
again
are
all
running
back
somewhere
and
I
shall
run
with
them
and
it
death
is
here
above
me
and
around
Another
instant
and
I
shall
never
again
see
the
sun
this
water
that
gorge
At
that
instant
the
sun
began
to
hide
behind
the
clouds
and
other
stretchers
came
into
view
before
Rostov
And
the
fear
of
death
and
of
the
stretchers
and
love
of
the
sun
and
of
life
all
merged
into
one
feeling
of
sickening
agitation
O
Lord
God
Thou
who
art
in
that
heaven
save
forgive
and
protect
me
Rostov
whispered
The
hussars
ran
back
to
the
men
who
held
their
horses
their
voices
sounded
louder
and
calmer
the
stretchers
disappeared
from
sight
Well
fwiend
So
you
ve
smelt
powdah
shouted
Vaska
Denisov
just
above
his
ear
It
s
all
over
but
I
am
a
coward
yes
a
coward
thought
Rostov
and
sighing
deeply
he
took
Rook
his
horse
which
stood
resting
one
foot
from
the
orderly
and
began
to
mount
Was
that
grapeshot
he
asked
Denisov
Yes
and
no
mistake
cried
Denisov
You
worked
like
wegular
bwicks
and
it
s
nasty
work
An
attack
s
pleasant
work
Hacking
away
at
the
dogs
But
this
sort
of
thing
is
the
very
devil
with
them
shooting
at
you
like
a
target
And
Denisov
rode
up
to
a
group
that
had
stopped
near
Rostov
composed
of
the
colonel
Nesvitski
Zherkov
and
the
officer
from
the
suite
Well
it
seems
that
no
one
has
noticed
thought
Rostov
And
this
was
true
No
one
had
taken
any
notice
for
everyone
knew
the
sensation
which
the
cadet
under
fire
for
the
first
time
had
experienced
Here
s
something
for
you
to
report
said
Zherkov
See
if
I
don
t
get
promoted
to
a
sublieutenancy
Inform
the
prince
that
I
the
bridge
fired
said
the
colonel
triumphantly
and
gaily
And
if
he
asks
about
the
losses
A
trifle
said
the
colonel
in
his
bass
voice
two
hussars
wounded
and
one
knocked
out
he
added
unable
to
restrain
a
happy
smile
and
pronouncing
the
phrase
knocked
out
with
ringing
distinctness
Pursued
by
the
French
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
under
the
command
of
Bonaparte
encountering
a
population
that
was
unfriendly
to
it
losing
confidence
in
its
allies
suffering
from
shortness
of
supplies
and
compelled
to
act
under
conditions
of
war
unlike
anything
that
had
been
foreseen
the
Russian
army
of
thirty
five
thousand
men
commanded
by
Kutuzov
was
hurriedly
retreating
along
the
Danube
stopping
where
overtaken
by
the
enemy
and
fighting
rearguard
actions
only
as
far
as
necessary
to
enable
it
to
retreat
without
losing
its
heavy
equipment
There
had
been
actions
at
Lambach
Amstetten
and
Melk
but
despite
the
courage
and
endurance
acknowledged
even
by
the
enemy
with
which
the
Russians
fought
the
only
consequence
of
these
actions
was
a
yet
more
rapid
retreat
Austrian
troops
that
had
escaped
capture
at
Ulm
and
had
joined
Kutuzov
at
Braunau
now
separated
from
the
Russian
army
and
Kutuzov
was
left
with
only
his
own
weak
and
exhausted
forces
The
defense
of
Vienna
was
no
longer
to
be
thought
of
Instead
of
an
offensive
the
plan
of
which
carefully
prepared
in
accord
with
the
modern
science
of
strategics
had
been
handed
to
Kutuzov
when
he
was
in
Vienna
by
the
Austrian
Hofkriegsrath
the
sole
and
almost
unattainable
aim
remaining
for
him
was
to
effect
a
junction
with
the
forces
that
were
advancing
from
Russia
without
losing
his
army
as
Mack
had
done
at
Ulm
On
the
twenty
eighth
of
October
Kutuzov
with
his
army
crossed
to
the
left
bank
of
the
Danube
and
took
up
a
position
for
the
first
time
with
the
river
between
himself
and
the
main
body
of
the
French
On
the
thirtieth
he
attacked
Mortier
s
division
which
was
on
the
left
bank
and
broke
it
up
In
this
action
for
the
first
time
trophies
were
taken
banners
cannon
and
two
enemy
generals
For
the
first
time
after
a
fortnight
s
retreat
the
Russian
troops
had
halted
and
after
a
fight
had
not
only
held
the
field
but
had
repulsed
the
French
Though
the
troops
were
ill
clad
exhausted
and
had
lost
a
third
of
their
number
in
killed
wounded
sick
and
stragglers
though
a
number
of
sick
and
wounded
had
been
abandoned
on
the
other
side
of
the
Danube
with
a
letter
in
which
Kutuzov
entrusted
them
to
the
humanity
of
the
enemy
and
though
the
big
hospitals
and
the
houses
in
Krems
converted
into
military
hospitals
could
no
longer
accommodate
all
the
sick
and
wounded
yet
the
stand
made
at
Krems
and
the
victory
over
Mortier
raised
the
spirits
of
the
army
considerably
Throughout
the
whole
army
and
at
headquarters
most
joyful
though
erroneous
rumors
were
rife
of
the
imaginary
approach
of
columns
from
Russia
of
some
victory
gained
by
the
Austrians
and
of
the
retreat
of
the
frightened
Bonaparte
Prince
Andrew
during
the
battle
had
been
in
attendance
on
the
Austrian
General
Schmidt
who
was
killed
in
the
action
His
horse
had
been
wounded
under
him
and
his
own
arm
slightly
grazed
by
a
bullet
As
a
mark
of
the
commander
in
chief
s
special
favor
he
was
sent
with
the
news
of
this
victory
to
the
Austrian
court
now
no
longer
at
Vienna
which
was
threatened
by
the
French
but
at
Brunn
Despite
his
apparently
delicate
build
Prince
Andrew
could
endure
physical
fatigue
far
better
than
many
very
muscular
men
and
on
the
night
of
the
battle
having
arrived
at
Krems
excited
but
not
weary
with
dispatches
from
Dokhturov
to
Kutuzov
he
was
sent
immediately
with
a
special
dispatch
to
Brunn
To
be
so
sent
meant
not
only
a
reward
but
an
important
step
toward
promotion
The
night
was
dark
but
starry
the
road
showed
black
in
the
snow
that
had
fallen
the
previous
day
the
day
of
the
battle
Reviewing
his
impressions
of
the
recent
battle
picturing
pleasantly
to
himself
the
impression
his
news
of
a
victory
would
create
or
recalling
the
send
off
given
him
by
the
commander
in
chief
and
his
fellow
officers
Prince
Andrew
was
galloping
along
in
a
post
chaise
enjoying
the
feelings
of
a
man
who
has
at
length
begun
to
attain
a
long
desired
happiness
As
soon
as
he
closed
his
eyes
his
ears
seemed
filled
with
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
and
the
sensation
of
victory
Then
he
began
to
imagine
that
the
Russians
were
running
away
and
that
he
himself
was
killed
but
he
quickly
roused
himself
with
a
feeling
of
joy
as
if
learning
afresh
that
this
was
not
so
but
that
on
the
contrary
the
French
had
run
away
He
again
recalled
all
the
details
of
the
victory
and
his
own
calm
courage
during
the
battle
and
feeling
reassured
he
dozed
off
The
dark
starry
night
was
followed
by
a
bright
cheerful
morning
The
snow
was
thawing
in
the
sunshine
the
horses
galloped
quickly
and
on
both
sides
of
the
road
were
forests
of
different
kinds
fields
and
villages
At
one
of
the
post
stations
he
overtook
a
convoy
of
Russian
wounded
The
Russian
officer
in
charge
of
the
transport
lolled
back
in
the
front
cart
shouting
and
scolding
a
soldier
with
coarse
abuse
In
each
of
the
long
German
carts
six
or
more
pale
dirty
bandaged
men
were
being
jolted
over
the
stony
road
Some
of
them
were
talking
he
heard
Russian
words
others
were
eating
bread
the
more
severely
wounded
looked
silently
with
the
languid
interest
of
sick
children
at
the
envoy
hurrying
past
them
Prince
Andrew
told
his
driver
to
stop
and
asked
a
soldier
in
what
action
they
had
been
wounded
Day
before
yesterday
on
the
Danube
answered
the
soldier
Prince
Andrew
took
out
his
purse
and
gave
the
soldier
three
gold
pieces
That
s
for
them
all
he
said
to
the
officer
who
came
up
Get
well
soon
lads
he
continued
turning
to
the
soldiers
There
s
plenty
to
do
still
What
news
sir
asked
the
officer
evidently
anxious
to
start
a
conversation
Good
news
Go
on
he
shouted
to
the
driver
and
they
galloped
on
It
was
already
quite
dark
when
Prince
Andrew
rattled
over
the
paved
streets
of
Brunn
and
found
himself
surrounded
by
high
buildings
the
lights
of
shops
houses
and
street
lamps
fine
carriages
and
all
that
atmosphere
of
a
large
and
active
town
which
is
always
so
attractive
to
a
soldier
after
camp
life
Despite
his
rapid
journey
and
sleepless
night
Prince
Andrew
when
he
drove
up
to
the
palace
felt
even
more
vigorous
and
alert
than
he
had
done
the
day
before
Only
his
eyes
gleamed
feverishly
and
his
thoughts
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
rapidity
He
again
vividly
recalled
the
details
of
the
battle
no
longer
dim
but
definite
and
in
the
concise
form
in
which
he
imagined
himself
stating
them
to
the
Emperor
Francis
He
vividly
imagined
the
casual
questions
that
might
be
put
to
him
and
the
answers
he
would
give
He
expected
to
be
at
once
presented
to
the
Emperor
At
the
chief
entrance
to
the
palace
however
an
official
came
running
out
to
meet
him
and
learning
that
he
was
a
special
messenger
led
him
to
another
entrance
To
the
right
from
the
corridor
Euer
Hochgeboren
There
you
will
find
the
adjutant
on
duty
said
the
official
He
will
conduct
you
to
the
Minister
of
War
The
adjutant
on
duty
meeting
Prince
Andrew
asked
him
to
wait
and
went
in
to
the
Minister
of
War
Five
minutes
later
he
returned
and
bowing
with
particular
courtesy
ushered
Prince
Andrew
before
him
along
a
corridor
to
the
cabinet
where
the
Minister
of
War
was
at
work
The
adjutant
by
his
elaborate
courtesy
appeared
to
wish
to
ward
off
any
attempt
at
familiarity
on
the
part
of
the
Russian
messenger
Prince
Andrew
s
joyous
feeling
was
considerably
weakened
as
he
approached
the
door
of
the
minister
s
room
He
felt
offended
and
without
his
noticing
it
the
feeling
of
offense
immediately
turned
into
one
of
disdain
which
was
quite
uncalled
for
His
fertile
mind
instantly
suggested
to
him
a
point
of
view
which
gave
him
a
right
to
despise
the
adjutant
and
the
minister
Away
from
the
smell
of
powder
they
probably
think
it
easy
to
gain
victories
he
thought
His
eyes
narrowed
disdainfully
he
entered
the
room
of
the
Minister
of
War
with
peculiarly
deliberate
steps
This
feeling
of
disdain
was
heightened
when
he
saw
the
minister
seated
at
a
large
table
reading
some
papers
and
making
pencil
notes
on
them
and
for
the
first
two
or
three
minutes
taking
no
notice
of
his
arrival
A
wax
candle
stood
at
each
side
of
the
minister
s
bent
bald
head
with
its
gray
temples
He
went
on
reading
to
the
end
without
raising
his
eyes
at
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
Take
this
and
deliver
it
said
he
to
his
adjutant
handing
him
the
papers
and
still
taking
no
notice
of
the
special
messenger
Prince
Andrew
felt
that
either
the
actions
of
Kutuzov
s
army
interested
the
Minister
of
War
less
than
any
of
the
other
matters
he
was
concerned
with
or
he
wanted
to
give
the
Russian
special
messenger
that
impression
But
that
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
he
thought
The
minister
drew
the
remaining
papers
together
arranged
them
evenly
and
then
raised
his
head
He
had
an
intellectual
and
distinctive
head
but
the
instant
he
turned
to
Prince
Andrew
the
firm
intelligent
expression
on
his
face
changed
in
a
way
evidently
deliberate
and
habitual
to
him
His
face
took
on
the
stupid
artificial
smile
which
does
not
even
attempt
to
hide
its
artificiality
of
a
man
who
is
continually
receiving
many
petitioners
one
after
another
From
General
Field
Marshal
Kutuzov
he
asked
I
hope
it
is
good
news
There
has
been
an
encounter
with
Mortier
A
victory
It
was
high
time
He
took
the
dispatch
which
was
addressed
to
him
and
began
to
read
it
with
a
mournful
expression
Oh
my
God
My
God
Schmidt
he
exclaimed
in
German
What
a
calamity
What
a
calamity
Having
glanced
through
the
dispatch
he
laid
it
on
the
table
and
looked
at
Prince
Andrew
evidently
considering
something
Ah
what
a
calamity
You
say
the
affair
was
decisive
But
Mortier
is
not
captured
Again
he
pondered
I
am
very
glad
you
have
brought
good
news
though
Schmidt
s
death
is
a
heavy
price
to
pay
for
the
victory
His
Majesty
will
no
doubt
wish
to
see
you
but
not
today
I
thank
you
You
must
have
a
rest
Be
at
the
levee
tomorrow
after
the
parade
However
I
will
let
you
know
The
stupid
smile
which
had
left
his
face
while
he
was
speaking
reappeared
Au
revoir
Thank
you
very
much
His
Majesty
will
probably
desire
to
see
you
he
added
bowing
his
head
When
Prince
Andrew
left
the
palace
he
felt
that
all
the
interest
and
happiness
the
victory
had
afforded
him
had
been
now
left
in
the
indifferent
hands
of
the
Minister
of
War
and
the
polite
adjutant
The
whole
tenor
of
his
thoughts
instantaneously
changed
the
battle
seemed
the
memory
of
a
remote
event
long
past
Prince
Andrew
stayed
at
Brunn
with
Bilibin
a
Russian
acquaintance
of
his
in
the
diplomatic
service
Ah
my
dear
prince
I
could
not
have
a
more
welcome
visitor
said
Bilibin
as
he
came
out
to
meet
Prince
Andrew
Franz
put
the
prince
s
things
in
my
bedroom
said
he
to
the
servant
who
was
ushering
Bolkonski
in
So
you
re
a
messenger
of
victory
eh
Splendid
And
I
am
sitting
here
ill
as
you
see
After
washing
and
dressing
Prince
Andrew
came
into
the
diplomat
s
luxurious
study
and
sat
down
to
the
dinner
prepared
for
him
Bilibin
settled
down
comfortably
beside
the
fire
After
his
journey
and
the
campaign
during
which
he
had
been
deprived
of
all
the
comforts
of
cleanliness
and
all
the
refinements
of
life
Prince
Andrew
felt
a
pleasant
sense
of
repose
among
luxurious
surroundings
such
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
from
childhood
Besides
it
was
pleasant
after
his
reception
by
the
Austrians
to
speak
if
not
in
Russian
for
they
were
speaking
French
at
least
with
a
Russian
who
would
he
supposed
share
the
general
Russian
antipathy
to
the
Austrians
which
was
then
particularly
strong
Bilibin
was
a
man
of
thirty
five
a
bachelor
and
of
the
same
circle
as
Prince
Andrew
They
had
known
each
other
previously
in
Petersburg
but
had
become
more
intimate
when
Prince
Andrew
was
in
Vienna
with
Kutuzov
Just
as
Prince
Andrew
was
a
young
man
who
gave
promise
of
rising
high
in
the
military
profession
so
to
an
even
greater
extent
Bilibin
gave
promise
of
rising
in
his
diplomatic
career
He
still
a
young
man
but
no
longer
a
young
diplomat
as
he
had
entered
the
service
at
the
age
of
sixteen
had
been
in
Paris
and
Copenhagen
and
now
held
a
rather
important
post
in
Vienna
Both
the
foreign
minister
and
our
ambassador
in
Vienna
knew
him
and
valued
him
He
was
not
one
of
those
many
diplomats
who
are
esteemed
because
they
have
certain
negative
qualities
avoid
doing
certain
things
and
speak
French
He
was
one
of
those
who
liking
work
knew
how
to
do
it
and
despite
his
indolence
would
sometimes
spend
a
whole
night
at
his
writing
table
He
worked
well
whatever
the
import
of
his
work
It
was
not
the
question
What
for
but
the
question
How
that
interested
him
What
the
diplomatic
matter
might
be
he
did
not
care
but
it
gave
him
great
pleasure
to
prepare
a
circular
memorandum
or
report
skillfully
pointedly
and
elegantly
Bilibin
s
services
were
valued
not
only
for
what
he
wrote
but
also
for
his
skill
in
dealing
and
conversing
with
those
in
the
highest
spheres
Bilibin
liked
conversation
as
he
liked
work
only
when
it
could
be
made
elegantly
witty
In
society
he
always
awaited
an
opportunity
to
say
something
striking
and
took
part
in
a
conversation
only
when
that
was
possible
His
conversation
was
always
sprinkled
with
wittily
original
finished
phrases
of
general
interest
These
sayings
were
prepared
in
the
inner
laboratory
of
his
mind
in
a
portable
form
as
if
intentionally
so
that
insignificant
society
people
might
carry
them
from
drawing
room
to
drawing
room
And
in
fact
Bilibin
s
witticisms
were
hawked
about
in
the
Viennese
drawing
rooms
and
often
had
an
influence
on
matters
considered
important
His
thin
worn
sallow
face
was
covered
with
deep
wrinkles
which
always
looked
as
clean
and
well
washed
as
the
tips
of
one
s
fingers
after
a
Russian
bath
The
movement
of
these
wrinkles
formed
the
principal
play
of
expression
on
his
face
Now
his
forehead
would
pucker
into
deep
folds
and
his
eyebrows
were
lifted
then
his
eyebrows
would
descend
and
deep
wrinkles
would
crease
his
cheeks
His
small
deep
set
eyes
always
twinkled
and
looked
out
straight
Well
now
tell
me
about
your
exploits
said
he
Bolkonski
very
modestly
without
once
mentioning
himself
described
the
engagement
and
his
reception
by
the
Minister
of
War
They
received
me
and
my
news
as
one
receives
a
dog
in
a
game
of
skittles
said
he
in
conclusion
Bilibin
smiled
and
the
wrinkles
on
his
face
disappeared
Cependant
mon
cher
he
remarked
examining
his
nails
from
a
distance
and
puckering
the
skin
above
his
left
eye
malgre
la
haute
estime
que
je
professe
pour
the
Orthodox
Russian
army
j
avoue
que
votre
victoire
n
est
pas
des
plus
victorieuses
But
my
dear
fellow
with
all
my
respect
for
the
Orthodox
Russian
army
I
must
say
that
your
victory
was
not
particularly
victorious
He
went
on
talking
in
this
way
in
French
uttering
only
those
words
in
Russian
on
which
he
wished
to
put
a
contemptuous
emphasis
Come
now
You
with
all
your
forces
fall
on
the
unfortunate
Mortier
and
his
one
division
and
even
then
Mortier
slips
through
your
fingers
Where
s
the
victory
But
seriously
said
Prince
Andrew
we
can
at
any
rate
say
without
boasting
that
it
was
a
little
better
than
at
Ulm
Why
didn
t
you
capture
one
just
one
marshal
for
us
Because
not
everything
happens
as
one
expects
or
with
the
smoothness
of
a
parade
We
had
expected
as
I
told
you
to
get
at
their
rear
by
seven
in
the
morning
but
had
not
reached
it
by
five
in
the
afternoon
And
why
didn
t
you
do
it
at
seven
in
the
morning
You
ought
to
have
been
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
returned
Bilibin
with
a
smile
You
ought
to
have
been
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
Why
did
you
not
succeed
in
impressing
on
Bonaparte
by
diplomatic
methods
that
he
had
better
leave
Genoa
alone
retorted
Prince
Andrew
in
the
same
tone
I
know
interrupted
Bilibin
you
re
thinking
it
s
very
easy
to
take
marshals
sitting
on
a
sofa
by
the
fire
That
is
true
but
still
why
didn
t
you
capture
him
So
don
t
be
surprised
if
not
only
the
Minister
of
War
but
also
his
Most
August
Majesty
the
Emperor
and
King
Francis
is
not
much
delighted
by
your
victory
Even
I
a
poor
secretary
of
the
Russian
Embassy
do
not
feel
any
need
in
token
of
my
joy
to
give
my
Franz
a
thaler
or
let
him
go
with
his
Liebchen
to
the
Prater
True
we
have
no
Prater
here
He
looked
straight
at
Prince
Andrew
and
suddenly
unwrinkled
his
forehead
It
is
now
my
turn
to
ask
you
why
mon
cher
said
Bolkonski
I
confess
I
do
not
understand
perhaps
there
are
diplomatic
subtleties
here
beyond
my
feeble
intelligence
but
I
can
t
make
it
out
Mack
loses
a
whole
army
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
and
the
Archduke
Karl
give
no
signs
of
life
and
make
blunder
after
blunder
Kutuzov
alone
at
last
gains
a
real
victory
destroying
the
spell
of
the
invincibility
of
the
French
and
the
Minister
of
War
does
not
even
care
to
hear
the
details
That
s
just
it
my
dear
fellow
You
see
it
s
hurrah
for
the
Tsar
for
Russia
for
the
Orthodox
Greek
faith
All
that
is
beautiful
but
what
do
we
I
mean
the
Austrian
court
care
for
your
victories
Bring
us
nice
news
of
a
victory
by
the
Archduke
Karl
or
Ferdinand
one
archduke
s
as
good
as
another
as
you
know
and
even
if
it
is
only
over
a
fire
brigade
of
Bonaparte
s
that
will
be
another
story
and
we
ll
fire
off
some
cannon
But
this
sort
of
thing
seems
done
on
purpose
to
vex
us
The
Archduke
Karl
does
nothing
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
disgraces
himself
You
abandon
Vienna
give
up
its
defense
as
much
as
to
say
Heaven
is
with
us
but
heaven
help
you
and
your
capital
The
one
general
whom
we
all
loved
Schmidt
you
expose
to
a
bullet
and
then
you
congratulate
us
on
the
victory
Admit
that
more
irritating
news
than
yours
could
not
have
been
conceived
It
s
as
if
it
had
been
done
on
purpose
on
purpose
Besides
suppose
you
did
gain
a
brilliant
victory
if
even
the
Archduke
Karl
gained
a
victory
what
effect
would
that
have
on
the
general
course
of
events
It
s
too
late
now
when
Vienna
is
occupied
by
the
French
army
What
Occupied
Vienna
occupied
Not
only
occupied
but
Bonaparte
is
at
Schonbrunn
and
the
count
our
dear
Count
Vrbna
goes
to
him
for
orders
After
the
fatigues
and
impressions
of
the
journey
his
reception
and
especially
after
having
dined
Bolkonski
felt
that
he
could
not
take
in
the
full
significance
of
the
words
he
heard
Count
Lichtenfels
was
here
this
morning
Bilibin
continued
and
showed
me
a
letter
in
which
the
parade
of
the
French
in
Vienna
was
fully
described
Prince
Murat
et
tout
le
tremblement
You
see
that
your
victory
is
not
a
matter
for
great
rejoicing
and
that
you
can
t
be
received
as
a
savior
Really
I
don
t
care
about
that
I
don
t
care
at
all
said
Prince
Andrew
beginning
to
understand
that
his
news
of
the
battle
before
Krems
was
really
of
small
importance
in
view
of
such
events
as
the
fall
of
Austria
s
capital
How
is
it
Vienna
was
taken
What
of
the
bridge
and
its
celebrated
bridgehead
and
Prince
Auersperg
We
heard
reports
that
Prince
Auersperg
was
defending
Vienna
he
said
Prince
Auersperg
is
on
this
on
our
side
of
the
river
and
is
defending
us
doing
it
very
badly
I
think
but
still
he
is
defending
us
But
Vienna
is
on
the
other
side
No
the
bridge
has
not
yet
been
taken
and
I
hope
it
will
not
be
for
it
is
mined
and
orders
have
been
given
to
blow
it
up
Otherwise
we
should
long
ago
have
been
in
the
mountains
of
Bohemia
and
you
and
your
army
would
have
spent
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
between
two
fires
But
still
this
does
not
mean
that
the
campaign
is
over
said
Prince
Andrew
Well
I
think
it
is
The
bigwigs
here
think
so
too
but
they
daren
t
say
so
It
will
be
as
I
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
it
won
t
be
your
skirmishing
at
Durrenstein
or
gunpowder
at
all
that
will
decide
the
matter
but
those
who
devised
it
said
Bilibin
quoting
one
of
his
own
mots
releasing
the
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
and
pausing
The
only
question
is
what
will
come
of
the
meeting
between
the
Emperor
Alexander
and
the
King
of
Prussia
in
Berlin
If
Prussia
joins
the
Allies
Austria
s
hand
will
be
forced
and
there
will
be
war
If
not
it
is
merely
a
question
of
settling
where
the
preliminaries
of
the
new
Campo
Formio
are
to
be
drawn
up
What
an
extraordinary
genius
Prince
Andrew
suddenly
exclaimed
clenching
his
small
hand
and
striking
the
table
with
it
and
what
luck
the
man
has
Buonaparte
said
Bilibin
inquiringly
puckering
up
his
forehead
to
indicate
that
he
was
about
to
say
something
witty
Buonaparte
he
repeated
accentuating
the
u
I
think
however
now
that
he
lays
down
laws
for
Austria
at
Schonbrunn
il
faut
lui
faire
grace
de
l
u
I
shall
certainly
adopt
an
innovation
and
call
him
simply
Bonaparte
We
must
let
him
off
the
u
But
joking
apart
said
Prince
Andrew
do
you
really
think
the
campaign
is
over
This
is
what
I
think
Austria
has
been
made
a
fool
of
and
she
is
not
used
to
it
She
will
retaliate
And
she
has
been
fooled
in
the
first
place
because
her
provinces
have
been
pillaged
they
say
the
Holy
Russian
army
loots
terribly
her
army
is
destroyed
her
capital
taken
and
all
this
for
the
beaux
yeux
of
His
Sardinian
Majesty
And
therefore
this
is
between
ourselves
I
instinctively
feel
that
we
are
being
deceived
my
instinct
tells
me
of
negotiations
with
France
and
projects
for
peace
a
secret
peace
concluded
separately
Fine
eyes
Impossible
cried
Prince
Andrew
That
would
be
too
base
If
we
live
we
shall
see
replied
Bilibin
his
face
again
becoming
smooth
as
a
sign
that
the
conversation
was
at
an
end
When
Prince
Andrew
reached
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
lay
down
in
a
clean
shirt
on
the
feather
bed
with
its
warmed
and
fragrant
pillows
he
felt
that
the
battle
of
which
he
had
brought
tidings
was
far
far
away
from
him
The
alliance
with
Prussia
Austria
s
treachery
Bonaparte
s
new
triumph
tomorrow
s
levee
and
parade
and
the
audience
with
the
Emperor
Francis
occupied
his
thoughts
He
closed
his
eyes
and
immediately
a
sound
of
cannonading
of
musketry
and
the
rattling
of
carriage
wheels
seemed
to
fill
his
ears
and
now
again
drawn
out
in
a
thin
line
the
musketeers
were
descending
the
hill
the
French
were
firing
and
he
felt
his
heart
palpitating
as
he
rode
forward
beside
Schmidt
with
the
bullets
merrily
whistling
all
around
and
he
experienced
tenfold
the
joy
of
living
as
he
had
not
done
since
childhood
He
woke
up
Yes
that
all
happened
he
said
and
smiling
happily
to
himself
like
a
child
he
fell
into
a
deep
youthful
slumber
Next
day
he
woke
late
Recalling
his
recent
impressions
the
first
thought
that
came
into
his
mind
was
that
today
he
had
to
be
presented
to
the
Emperor
Francis
he
remembered
the
Minister
of
War
the
polite
Austrian
adjutant
Bilibin
and
last
night
s
conversation
Having
dressed
for
his
attendance
at
court
in
full
parade
uniform
which
he
had
not
worn
for
a
long
time
he
went
into
Bilibin
s
study
fresh
animated
and
handsome
with
his
hand
bandaged
In
the
study
were
four
gentlemen
of
the
diplomatic
corps
With
Prince
Hippolyte
Kuragin
who
was
a
secretary
to
the
embassy
Bolkonski
was
already
acquainted
Bilibin
introduced
him
to
the
others
The
gentlemen
assembled
at
Bilibin
s
were
young
wealthy
gay
society
men
who
here
as
in
Vienna
formed
a
special
set
which
Bilibin
their
leader
called
les
notres
This
set
consisting
almost
exclusively
of
diplomats
evidently
had
its
own
interests
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
war
or
politics
but
related
to
high
society
to
certain
women
and
to
the
official
side
of
the
service
These
gentlemen
received
Prince
Andrew
as
one
of
themselves
an
honor
they
did
not
extend
to
many
From
politeness
and
to
start
conversation
they
asked
him
a
few
questions
about
the
army
and
the
battle
and
then
the
talk
went
off
into
merry
jests
and
gossip
Ours
But
the
best
of
it
was
said
one
telling
of
the
misfortune
of
a
fellow
diplomat
that
the
Chancellor
told
him
flatly
that
his
appointment
to
London
was
a
promotion
and
that
he
was
so
to
regard
it
Can
you
fancy
the
figure
he
cut
But
the
worst
of
it
gentlemen
I
am
giving
Kuragin
away
to
you
is
that
that
man
suffers
and
this
Don
Juan
wicked
fellow
is
taking
advantage
of
it
Prince
Hippolyte
was
lolling
in
a
lounge
chair
with
his
legs
over
its
arm
He
began
to
laugh
Tell
me
about
that
he
said
Oh
you
Don
Juan
You
serpent
cried
several
voices
You
Bolkonski
don
t
know
said
Bilibin
turning
to
Prince
Andrew
that
all
the
atrocities
of
the
French
army
I
nearly
said
of
the
Russian
army
are
nothing
compared
to
what
this
man
has
been
doing
among
the
women
La
femme
est
la
compagne
de
l
homme
announced
Prince
Hippolyte
and
began
looking
through
a
lorgnette
at
his
elevated
legs
Woman
is
man
s
companion
Bilibin
and
the
rest
of
ours
burst
out
laughing
in
Hippolyte
s
face
and
Prince
Andrew
saw
that
Hippolyte
of
whom
he
had
to
admit
he
had
almost
been
jealous
on
his
wife
s
account
was
the
butt
of
this
set
Oh
I
must
give
you
a
treat
Bilibin
whispered
to
Bolkonski
Kuragin
is
exquisite
when
he
discusses
politics
you
should
see
his
gravity
He
sat
down
beside
Hippolyte
and
wrinkling
his
forehead
began
talking
to
him
about
politics
Prince
Andrew
and
the
others
gathered
round
these
two
The
Berlin
cabinet
cannot
express
a
feeling
of
alliance
began
Hippolyte
gazing
round
with
importance
at
the
others
without
expressing
as
in
its
last
note
you
understand
Besides
unless
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
derogates
from
the
principle
of
our
alliance
Wait
I
have
not
finished
he
said
to
Prince
Andrew
seizing
him
by
the
arm
I
believe
that
intervention
will
be
stronger
than
nonintervention
And
he
paused
Finally
one
cannot
impute
the
nonreceipt
of
our
dispatch
of
November
That
is
how
it
will
end
And
he
released
Bolkonski
s
arm
to
indicate
that
he
had
now
quite
finished
Demosthenes
I
know
thee
by
the
pebble
thou
secretest
in
thy
golden
mouth
said
Bilibin
and
the
mop
of
hair
on
his
head
moved
with
satisfaction
Everybody
laughed
and
Hippolyte
louder
than
anyone
He
was
evidently
distressed
and
breathed
painfully
but
could
not
restrain
the
wild
laughter
that
convulsed
his
usually
impassive
features
Well
now
gentlemen
said
Bilibin
Bolkonski
is
my
guest
in
this
house
and
in
Brunn
itself
I
want
to
entertain
him
as
far
as
I
can
with
all
the
pleasures
of
life
here
If
we
were
in
Vienna
it
would
be
easy
but
here
in
this
wretched
Moravian
hole
it
is
more
difficult
and
I
beg
you
all
to
help
me
Brunn
s
attractions
must
be
shown
him
You
can
undertake
the
theater
I
society
and
you
Hippolyte
of
course
the
women
We
must
let
him
see
Amelie
she
s
exquisite
said
one
of
ours
kissing
his
finger
tips
In
general
we
must
turn
this
bloodthirsty
soldier
to
more
humane
interests
said
Bilibin
I
shall
scarcely
be
able
to
avail
myself
of
your
hospitality
gentlemen
it
is
already
time
for
me
to
go
replied
Prince
Andrew
looking
at
his
watch
Where
to
To
the
Emperor
Oh
Oh
Oh
Well
au
revoir
Bolkonski
Au
revoir
Prince
Come
back
early
to
dinner
cried
several
voices
We
ll
take
you
in
hand
When
speaking
to
the
Emperor
try
as
far
as
you
can
to
praise
the
way
that
provisions
are
supplied
and
the
routes
indicated
said
Bilibin
accompanying
him
to
the
hall
I
should
like
to
speak
well
of
them
but
as
far
as
I
know
the
facts
I
can
t
replied
Bolkonski
smiling
Well
talk
as
much
as
you
can
anyway
He
has
a
passion
for
giving
audiences
but
he
does
not
like
talking
himself
and
can
t
do
it
as
you
will
see
At
the
levee
Prince
Andrew
stood
among
the
Austrian
officers
as
he
had
been
told
to
and
the
Emperor
Francis
merely
looked
fixedly
into
his
face
and
just
nodded
to
him
with
his
long
head
But
after
it
was
over
the
adjutant
he
had
seen
the
previous
day
ceremoniously
informed
Bolkonski
that
the
Emperor
desired
to
give
him
an
audience
The
Emperor
Francis
received
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
Before
the
conversation
began
Prince
Andrew
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
Emperor
seemed
confused
and
blushed
as
if
not
knowing
what
to
say
Tell
me
when
did
the
battle
begin
he
asked
hurriedly
Prince
Andrew
replied
Then
followed
other
questions
just
as
simple
Was
Kutuzov
well
When
had
he
left
Krems
and
so
on
The
Emperor
spoke
as
if
his
sole
aim
were
to
put
a
given
number
of
questions
the
answers
to
these
questions
as
was
only
too
evident
did
not
interest
him
At
what
o
clock
did
the
battle
begin
asked
the
Emperor
I
cannot
inform
Your
Majesty
at
what
o
clock
the
battle
began
at
the
front
but
at
Durrenstein
where
I
was
our
attack
began
after
five
in
the
afternoon
replied
Bolkonski
growing
more
animated
and
expecting
that
he
would
have
a
chance
to
give
a
reliable
account
which
he
had
ready
in
his
mind
of
all
he
knew
and
had
seen
But
the
Emperor
smiled
and
interrupted
him
How
many
miles
From
where
to
where
Your
Majesty
From
Durrenstein
to
Krems
Three
and
a
half
miles
Your
Majesty
The
French
have
abandoned
the
left
bank
According
to
the
scouts
the
last
of
them
crossed
on
rafts
during
the
night
Is
there
sufficient
forage
in
Krems
Forage
has
not
been
supplied
to
the
extent
The
Emperor
interrupted
him
At
what
o
clock
was
General
Schmidt
killed
At
seven
o
clock
I
believe
At
seven
o
clock
It
s
very
sad
very
sad
The
Emperor
thanked
Prince
Andrew
and
bowed
Prince
Andrew
withdrew
and
was
immediately
surrounded
by
courtiers
on
all
sides
Everywhere
he
saw
friendly
looks
and
heard
friendly
words
Yesterday
s
adjutant
reproached
him
for
not
having
stayed
at
the
palace
and
offered
him
his
own
house
The
Minister
of
War
came
up
and
congratulated
him
on
the
Maria
Theresa
Order
of
the
third
grade
which
the
Emperor
was
conferring
on
him
The
Empress
chamberlain
invited
him
to
see
Her
Majesty
The
archduchess
also
wished
to
see
him
He
did
not
know
whom
to
answer
and
for
a
few
seconds
collected
his
thoughts
Then
the
Russian
ambassador
took
him
by
the
shoulder
led
him
to
the
window
and
began
to
talk
to
him
Contrary
to
Bilibin
s
forecast
the
news
he
had
brought
was
joyfully
received
A
thanksgiving
service
was
arranged
Kutuzov
was
awarded
the
Grand
Cross
of
Maria
Theresa
and
the
whole
army
received
rewards
Bolkonski
was
invited
everywhere
and
had
to
spend
the
whole
morning
calling
on
the
principal
Austrian
dignitaries
Between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
having
made
all
his
calls
he
was
returning
to
Bilibin
s
house
thinking
out
a
letter
to
his
father
about
the
battle
and
his
visit
to
Brunn
At
the
door
he
found
a
vehicle
half
full
of
luggage
Franz
Bilibin
s
man
was
dragging
a
portmanteau
with
some
difficulty
out
of
the
front
door
Before
returning
to
Bilibin
s
Prince
Andrew
had
gone
to
a
bookshop
to
provide
himself
with
some
books
for
the
campaign
and
had
spent
some
time
in
the
shop
What
is
it
he
asked
Oh
your
excellency
said
Franz
with
difficulty
rolling
the
portmanteau
into
the
vehicle
we
are
to
move
on
still
farther
The
scoundrel
is
again
at
our
heels
Eh
What
asked
Prince
Andrew
Bilibin
came
out
to
meet
him
His
usually
calm
face
showed
excitement
There
now
Confess
that
this
is
delightful
said
he
This
affair
of
the
Thabor
Bridge
at
Vienna
They
have
crossed
without
striking
a
blow
Prince
Andrew
could
not
understand
But
where
do
you
come
from
not
to
know
what
every
coachman
in
the
town
knows
I
come
from
the
archduchess
I
heard
nothing
there
And
you
didn
t
see
that
everybody
is
packing
up
I
did
not
What
is
it
all
about
inquired
Prince
Andrew
impatiently
What
s
it
all
about
Why
the
French
have
crossed
the
bridge
that
Auersperg
was
defending
and
the
bridge
was
not
blown
up
so
Murat
is
now
rushing
along
the
road
to
Brunn
and
will
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
What
Here
But
why
did
they
not
blow
up
the
bridge
if
it
was
mined
That
is
what
I
ask
you
No
one
not
even
Bonaparte
knows
why
Bolkonski
shrugged
his
shoulders
But
if
the
bridge
is
crossed
it
means
that
the
army
too
is
lost
It
will
be
cut
off
said
he
That
s
just
it
answered
Bilibin
Listen
The
French
entered
Vienna
as
I
told
you
Very
well
Next
day
which
was
yesterday
those
gentlemen
messieurs
les
marechaux
Murat
Lannes
and
Belliard
mount
and
ride
to
the
bridge
Observe
that
all
three
are
Gascons
Gentlemen
says
one
of
them
you
know
the
Thabor
Bridge
is
mined
and
doubly
mined
and
that
there
are
menacing
fortifications
at
its
head
and
an
army
of
fifteen
thousand
men
has
been
ordered
to
blow
up
the
bridge
and
not
let
us
cross
But
it
will
please
our
sovereign
the
Emperor
Napoleon
if
we
take
this
bridge
so
let
us
three
go
and
take
it
Yes
let
s
say
the
others
And
off
they
go
and
take
the
bridge
cross
it
and
now
with
their
whole
army
are
on
this
side
of
the
Danube
marching
on
us
you
and
your
lines
of
communication
The
marshalls
Stop
jesting
said
Prince
Andrew
sadly
and
seriously
This
news
grieved
him
and
yet
he
was
pleased
As
soon
as
he
learned
that
the
Russian
army
was
in
such
a
hopeless
situation
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
was
destined
to
lead
it
out
of
this
position
that
here
was
the
Toulon
that
would
lift
him
from
the
ranks
of
obscure
officers
and
offer
him
the
first
step
to
fame
Listening
to
Bilibin
he
was
already
imagining
how
on
reaching
the
army
he
would
give
an
opinion
at
the
war
council
which
would
be
the
only
one
that
could
save
the
army
and
how
he
alone
would
be
entrusted
with
the
executing
of
the
plan
Stop
this
jesting
he
said
I
am
not
jesting
Bilibin
went
on
Nothing
is
truer
or
sadder
These
gentlemen
ride
onto
the
bridge
alone
and
wave
white
handkerchiefs
they
assure
the
officer
on
duty
that
they
the
marshals
are
on
their
way
to
negotiate
with
Prince
Auersperg
He
lets
them
enter
the
tete
de
pont
They
spin
him
a
thousand
gasconades
saying
that
the
war
is
over
that
the
Emperor
Francis
is
arranging
a
meeting
with
Bonaparte
that
they
desire
to
see
Prince
Auersperg
and
so
on
The
officer
sends
for
Auersperg
these
gentlemen
embrace
the
officers
crack
jokes
sit
on
the
cannon
and
meanwhile
a
French
battalion
gets
to
the
bridge
unobserved
flings
the
bags
of
incendiary
material
into
the
water
and
approaches
the
tete
de
pont
At
length
appears
the
lieutenant
general
our
dear
Prince
Auersperg
von
Mautern
himself
Dearest
foe
Flower
of
the
Austrian
army
hero
of
the
Turkish
wars
Hostilities
are
ended
we
can
shake
one
another
s
hand
The
Emperor
Napoleon
burns
with
impatience
to
make
Prince
Auersperg
s
acquaintance
In
a
word
those
gentlemen
Gascons
indeed
so
bewildered
him
with
fine
words
and
he
is
so
flattered
by
his
rapidly
established
intimacy
with
the
French
marshals
and
so
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
Murat
s
mantle
and
ostrich
plumes
qu
il
n
y
voit
que
du
feu
et
oublie
celui
qu
il
devait
faire
faire
sur
l
ennemi
In
spite
of
the
animation
of
his
speech
Bilibin
did
not
forget
to
pause
after
this
mot
to
give
time
for
its
due
appreciation
The
French
battalion
rushes
to
the
bridgehead
spikes
the
guns
and
the
bridge
is
taken
But
what
is
best
of
all
he
went
on
his
excitement
subsiding
under
the
delightful
interest
of
his
own
story
is
that
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
cannon
which
was
to
give
the
signal
to
fire
the
mines
and
blow
up
the
bridge
this
sergeant
seeing
that
the
French
troops
were
running
onto
the
bridge
was
about
to
fire
but
Lannes
stayed
his
hand
The
sergeant
who
was
evidently
wiser
than
his
general
goes
up
to
Auersperg
and
says
Prince
you
are
being
deceived
here
are
the
French
Murat
seeing
that
all
is
lost
if
the
sergeant
is
allowed
to
speak
turns
to
Auersperg
with
feigned
astonishment
he
is
a
true
Gascon
and
says
I
don
t
recognize
the
world
famous
Austrian
discipline
if
you
allow
a
subordinate
to
address
you
like
that
It
was
a
stroke
of
genius
Prince
Auersperg
feels
his
dignity
at
stake
and
orders
the
sergeant
to
be
arrested
Come
you
must
own
that
this
affair
of
the
Thabor
Bridge
is
delightful
It
is
not
exactly
stupidity
nor
rascality
Bridgehead
That
their
fire
gets
into
his
eyes
and
he
forgets
that
he
ought
to
be
firing
at
the
enemy
It
may
be
treachery
said
Prince
Andrew
vividly
imagining
the
gray
overcoats
wounds
the
smoke
of
gunpowder
the
sounds
of
firing
and
the
glory
that
awaited
him
Not
that
either
That
puts
the
court
in
too
bad
a
light
replied
Bilibin
It
s
not
treachery
nor
rascality
nor
stupidity
it
is
just
as
at
Ulm
it
is
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
find
the
right
expression
C
est
c
est
du
Mack
Nous
sommes
mackes
It
is
it
is
a
bit
of
Mack
We
are
Macked
he
concluded
feeling
that
he
had
produced
a
good
epigram
a
fresh
one
that
would
be
repeated
His
hitherto
puckered
brow
became
smooth
as
a
sign
of
pleasure
and
with
a
slight
smile
he
began
to
examine
his
nails
Where
are
you
off
to
he
said
suddenly
to
Prince
Andrew
who
had
risen
and
was
going
toward
his
room
I
am
going
away
Where
to
To
the
army
But
you
meant
to
stay
another
two
days
But
now
I
am
off
at
once
And
Prince
Andrew
after
giving
directions
about
his
departure
went
to
his
room
Do
you
know
mon
cher
said
Bilibin
following
him
I
have
been
thinking
about
you
Why
are
you
going
And
in
proof
of
the
conclusiveness
of
his
opinion
all
the
wrinkles
vanished
from
his
face
Prince
Andrew
looked
inquiringly
at
him
and
gave
no
reply
Why
are
you
going
I
know
you
think
it
your
duty
to
gallop
back
to
the
army
now
that
it
is
in
danger
I
understand
that
Mon
cher
it
is
heroism
Not
at
all
said
Prince
Andrew
But
as
you
are
a
philosopher
be
a
consistent
one
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
question
and
you
will
see
that
your
duty
on
the
contrary
is
to
take
care
of
yourself
Leave
it
to
those
who
are
no
longer
fit
for
anything
else
You
have
not
been
ordered
to
return
and
have
not
been
dismissed
from
here
therefore
you
can
stay
and
go
with
us
wherever
our
ill
luck
takes
us
They
say
we
are
going
to
Olmutz
and
Olmutz
is
a
very
decent
town
You
and
I
will
travel
comfortably
in
my
caleche
Do
stop
joking
Bilibin
cried
Bolkonski
I
am
speaking
sincerely
as
a
friend
Consider
Where
and
why
are
you
going
when
you
might
remain
here
You
are
faced
by
one
of
two
things
and
the
skin
over
his
left
temple
puckered
either
you
will
not
reach
your
regiment
before
peace
is
concluded
or
you
will
share
defeat
and
disgrace
with
Kutuzov
s
whole
army
And
Bilibin
unwrinkled
his
temple
feeling
that
the
dilemma
was
insoluble
I
cannot
argue
about
it
replied
Prince
Andrew
coldly
but
he
thought
I
am
going
to
save
the
army
My
dear
fellow
you
are
a
hero
said
Bilibin
That
same
night
having
taken
leave
of
the
Minister
of
War
Bolkonski
set
off
to
rejoin
the
army
not
knowing
where
he
would
find
it
and
fearing
to
be
captured
by
the
French
on
the
way
to
Krems
In
Brunn
everybody
attached
to
the
court
was
packing
up
and
the
heavy
baggage
was
already
being
dispatched
to
Olmutz
Near
Hetzelsdorf
Prince
Andrew
struck
the
high
road
along
which
the
Russian
army
was
moving
with
great
haste
and
in
the
greatest
disorder
The
road
was
so
obstructed
with
carts
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
by
in
a
carriage
Prince
Andrew
took
a
horse
and
a
Cossack
from
a
Cossack
commander
and
hungry
and
weary
making
his
way
past
the
baggage
wagons
rode
in
search
of
the
commander
in
chief
and
of
his
own
luggage
Very
sinister
reports
of
the
position
of
the
army
reached
him
as
he
went
along
and
the
appearance
of
the
troops
in
their
disorderly
flight
confirmed
these
rumors
Cette
armee
russe
que
l
or
de
l
Angleterre
a
transportee
des
extremites
de
l
univers
nous
allons
lui
faire
eprouver
le
meme
sort
le
sort
de
l
armee
d
Ulm
He
remembered
these
words
in
Bonaparte
s
address
to
his
army
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
and
they
awoke
in
him
astonishment
at
the
genius
of
his
hero
a
feeling
of
wounded
pride
and
a
hope
of
glory
And
should
there
be
nothing
left
but
to
die
he
thought
Well
if
need
be
I
shall
do
it
no
worse
than
others
That
Russian
army
which
has
been
brought
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
by
English
gold
we
shall
cause
to
share
the
same
fate
the
fate
of
the
army
at
Ulm
He
looked
with
disdain
at
the
endless
confused
mass
of
detachments
carts
guns
artillery
and
again
baggage
wagons
and
vehicles
of
all
kinds
overtaking
one
another
and
blocking
the
muddy
road
three
and
sometimes
four
abreast
From
all
sides
behind
and
before
as
far
as
ear
could
reach
there
were
the
rattle
of
wheels
the
creaking
of
carts
and
gun
carriages
the
tramp
of
horses
the
crack
of
whips
shouts
the
urging
of
horses
and
the
swearing
of
soldiers
orderlies
and
officers
All
along
the
sides
of
the
road
fallen
horses
were
to
be
seen
some
flayed
some
not
and
broken
down
carts
beside
which
solitary
soldiers
sat
waiting
for
something
and
again
soldiers
straggling
from
their
companies
crowds
of
whom
set
off
to
the
neighboring
villages
or
returned
from
them
dragging
sheep
fowls
hay
and
bulging
sacks
At
each
ascent
or
descent
of
the
road
the
crowds
were
yet
denser
and
the
din
of
shouting
more
incessant
Soldiers
floundering
knee
deep
in
mud
pushed
the
guns
and
wagons
themselves
Whips
cracked
hoofs
slipped
traces
broke
and
lungs
were
strained
with
shouting
The
officers
directing
the
march
rode
backward
and
forward
between
the
carts
Their
voices
were
but
feebly
heard
amid
the
uproar
and
one
saw
by
their
faces
that
they
despaired
of
the
possibility
of
checking
this
disorder
Here
is
our
dear
Orthodox
Russian
army
thought
Bolkonski
recalling
Bilibin
s
words
Wishing
to
find
out
where
the
commander
in
chief
was
he
rode
up
to
a
convoy
Directly
opposite
to
him
came
a
strange
one
horse
vehicle
evidently
rigged
up
by
soldiers
out
of
any
available
materials
and
looking
like
something
between
a
cart
a
cabriolet
and
a
caleche
A
soldier
was
driving
and
a
woman
enveloped
in
shawls
sat
behind
the
apron
under
the
leather
hood
of
the
vehicle
Prince
Andrew
rode
up
and
was
just
putting
his
question
to
a
soldier
when
his
attention
was
diverted
by
the
desperate
shrieks
of
the
woman
in
the
vehicle
An
officer
in
charge
of
transport
was
beating
the
soldier
who
was
driving
the
woman
s
vehicle
for
trying
to
get
ahead
of
others
and
the
strokes
of
his
whip
fell
on
the
apron
of
the
equipage
The
woman
screamed
piercingly
Seeing
Prince
Andrew
she
leaned
out
from
behind
the
apron
and
waving
her
thin
arms
from
under
the
woolen
shawl
cried
Mr
Aide
de
camp
Mr
Aide
de
camp
For
heaven
s
sake
Protect
me
What
will
become
of
us
I
am
the
wife
of
the
doctor
of
the
Seventh
Chasseurs
They
won
t
let
us
pass
we
are
left
behind
and
have
lost
our
people
I
ll
flatten
you
into
a
pancake
shouted
the
angry
officer
to
the
soldier
Turn
back
with
your
slut
Mr
Aide
de
camp
Help
me
What
does
it
all
mean
screamed
the
doctor
s
wife
Kindly
let
this
cart
pass
Don
t
you
see
it
s
a
woman
said
Prince
Andrew
riding
up
to
the
officer
The
officer
glanced
at
him
and
without
replying
turned
again
to
the
soldier
I
ll
teach
you
to
push
on
Back
Let
them
pass
I
tell
you
repeated
Prince
Andrew
compressing
his
lips
And
who
are
you
cried
the
officer
turning
on
him
with
tipsy
rage
who
are
you
Are
you
in
command
here
Eh
I
am
commander
here
not
you
Go
back
or
I
ll
flatten
you
into
a
pancake
repeated
he
This
expression
evidently
pleased
him
That
was
a
nice
snub
for
the
little
aide
de
camp
came
a
voice
from
behind
Prince
Andrew
saw
that
the
officer
was
in
that
state
of
senseless
tipsy
rage
when
a
man
does
not
know
what
he
is
saying
He
saw
that
his
championship
of
the
doctor
s
wife
in
her
queer
trap
might
expose
him
to
what
he
dreaded
more
than
anything
in
the
world
to
ridicule
but
his
instinct
urged
him
on
Before
the
officer
finished
his
sentence
Prince
Andrew
his
face
distorted
with
fury
rode
up
to
him
and
raised
his
riding
whip
Kind
ly
let
them
pass
The
officer
flourished
his
arm
and
hastily
rode
away
It
s
all
the
fault
of
these
fellows
on
the
staff
that
there
s
this
disorder
he
muttered
Do
as
you
like
Prince
Andrew
without
lifting
his
eyes
rode
hastily
away
from
the
doctor
s
wife
who
was
calling
him
her
deliverer
and
recalling
with
a
sense
of
disgust
the
minutest
details
of
this
humiliating
scene
he
galloped
on
to
the
village
where
he
was
told
that
the
commander
in
chief
was
On
reaching
the
village
he
dismounted
and
went
to
the
nearest
house
intending
to
rest
if
but
for
a
moment
eat
something
and
try
to
sort
out
the
stinging
and
tormenting
thoughts
that
confused
his
mind
This
is
a
mob
of
scoundrels
and
not
an
army
he
was
thinking
as
he
went
up
to
the
window
of
the
first
house
when
a
familiar
voice
called
him
by
name
He
turned
round
Nesvitski
s
handsome
face
looked
out
of
the
little
window
Nesvitski
moving
his
moist
lips
as
he
chewed
something
and
flourishing
his
arm
called
him
to
enter
Bolkonski
Bolkonski
Don
t
you
hear
Eh
Come
quick
he
shouted
Entering
the
house
Prince
Andrew
saw
Nesvitski
and
another
adjutant
having
something
to
eat
They
hastily
turned
round
to
him
asking
if
he
had
any
news
On
their
familiar
faces
he
read
agitation
and
alarm
This
was
particularly
noticeable
on
Nesvitski
s
usually
laughing
countenance
Where
is
the
commander
in
chief
asked
Bolkonski
Here
in
that
house
answered
the
adjutant
Well
is
it
true
that
it
s
peace
and
capitulation
asked
Nesvitski
I
was
going
to
ask
you
I
know
nothing
except
that
it
was
all
I
could
do
to
get
here
And
we
my
dear
boy
It
s
terrible
I
was
wrong
to
laugh
at
Mack
we
re
getting
it
still
worse
said
Nesvitski
But
sit
down
and
have
something
to
eat
You
won
t
be
able
to
find
either
your
baggage
or
anything
else
now
Prince
And
God
only
knows
where
your
man
Peter
is
said
the
other
adjutant
Where
are
headquarters
We
are
to
spend
the
night
in
Znaim
Well
I
have
got
all
I
need
into
packs
for
two
horses
said
Nesvitski
They
ve
made
up
splendid
packs
for
me
fit
to
cross
the
Bohemian
mountains
with
It
s
a
bad
lookout
old
fellow
But
what
s
the
matter
with
you
You
must
be
ill
to
shiver
like
that
he
added
noticing
that
Prince
Andrew
winced
as
at
an
electric
shock
It
s
nothing
replied
Prince
Andrew
He
had
just
remembered
his
recent
encounter
with
the
doctor
s
wife
and
the
convoy
officer
What
is
the
commander
in
chief
doing
here
he
asked
I
can
t
make
out
at
all
said
Nesvitski
Well
all
I
can
make
out
is
that
everything
is
abominable
abominable
quite
abominable
said
Prince
Andrew
and
he
went
off
to
the
house
where
the
commander
in
chief
was
Passing
by
Kutuzov
s
carriage
and
the
exhausted
saddle
horses
of
his
suite
with
their
Cossacks
who
were
talking
loudly
together
Prince
Andrew
entered
the
passage
Kutuzov
himself
he
was
told
was
in
the
house
with
Prince
Bagration
and
Weyrother
Weyrother
was
the
Austrian
general
who
had
succeeded
Schmidt
In
the
passage
little
Kozlovski
was
squatting
on
his
heels
in
front
of
a
clerk
The
clerk
with
cuffs
turned
up
was
hastily
writing
at
a
tub
turned
bottom
upwards
Kozlovski
s
face
looked
worn
he
too
had
evidently
not
slept
all
night
He
glanced
at
Prince
Andrew
and
did
not
even
nod
to
him
Second
line
have
you
written
it
he
continued
dictating
to
the
clerk
The
Kiev
Grenadiers
Podolian
One
can
t
write
so
fast
your
honor
said
the
clerk
glancing
angrily
and
disrespectfully
at
Kozlovski
Through
the
door
came
the
sounds
of
Kutuzov
s
voice
excited
and
dissatisfied
interrupted
by
another
an
unfamiliar
voice
From
the
sound
of
these
voices
the
inattentive
way
Kozlovski
looked
at
him
the
disrespectful
manner
of
the
exhausted
clerk
the
fact
that
the
clerk
and
Kozlovski
were
squatting
on
the
floor
by
a
tub
so
near
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
from
the
noisy
laughter
of
the
Cossacks
holding
the
horses
near
the
window
Prince
Andrew
felt
that
something
important
and
disastrous
was
about
to
happen
He
turned
to
Kozlovski
with
urgent
questions
Immediately
Prince
said
Kozlovski
Dispositions
for
Bagration
What
about
capitulation
Nothing
of
the
sort
Orders
are
issued
for
a
battle
Prince
Andrew
moved
toward
the
door
from
whence
voices
were
heard
Just
as
he
was
going
to
open
it
the
sounds
ceased
the
door
opened
and
Kutuzov
with
his
eagle
nose
and
puffy
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
Prince
Andrew
stood
right
in
front
of
Kutuzov
but
the
expression
of
the
commander
in
chief
s
one
sound
eye
showed
him
to
be
so
preoccupied
with
thoughts
and
anxieties
as
to
be
oblivious
of
his
presence
He
looked
straight
at
his
adjutant
s
face
without
recognizing
him
Well
have
you
finished
said
he
to
Kozlovski
One
moment
your
excellency
Bagration
a
gaunt
middle
aged
man
of
medium
height
with
a
firm
impassive
face
of
Oriental
type
came
out
after
the
commander
in
chief
I
have
the
honor
to
present
myself
repeated
Prince
Andrew
rather
loudly
handing
Kutuzov
an
envelope
Ah
from
Vienna
Very
good
Later
later
Kutuzov
went
out
into
the
porch
with
Bagration
Well
good
by
Prince
said
he
to
Bagration
My
blessing
and
may
Christ
be
with
you
in
your
great
endeavor
His
face
suddenly
softened
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
With
his
left
hand
he
drew
Bagration
toward
him
and
with
his
right
on
which
he
wore
a
ring
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
with
a
gesture
evidently
habitual
offering
his
puffy
cheek
but
Bagration
kissed
him
on
the
neck
instead
Christ
be
with
you
Kutuzov
repeated
and
went
toward
his
carriage
Get
in
with
me
said
he
to
Bolkonski
Your
excellency
I
should
like
to
be
of
use
here
Allow
me
to
remain
with
Prince
Bagration
s
detachment
Get
in
said
Kutuzov
and
noticing
that
Bolkonski
still
delayed
he
added
I
need
good
officers
myself
need
them
myself
They
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
There
is
still
much
much
before
us
he
said
as
if
with
an
old
man
s
penetration
he
understood
all
that
was
passing
in
Bolkonski
s
mind
If
a
tenth
part
of
his
detachment
returns
I
shall
thank
God
he
added
as
if
speaking
to
himself
Prince
Andrew
glanced
at
Kutuzov
s
face
only
a
foot
distant
from
him
