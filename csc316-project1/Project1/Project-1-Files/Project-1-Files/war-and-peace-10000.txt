only
knew
everyone
in
the
drawing
room
but
had
found
them
to
be
so
tiresome
that
it
wearied
him
to
look
at
or
listen
to
them
And
among
all
these
faces
that
he
found
so
tedious
none
seemed
to
bore
him
so
much
as
that
of
his
pretty
wife
He
turned
away
from
her
with
a
grimace
that
distorted
his
handsome
face
kissed
Anna
Pavlovna
s
hand
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
scanned
the
whole
company
You
are
off
to
the
war
Prince
said
Anna
Pavlovna
General
Kutuzov
said
Bolkonski
speaking
French
and
stressing
the
last
syllable
of
the
general
s
name
like
a
Frenchman
has
been
pleased
to
take
me
as
an
aide
de
camp
And
Lise
your
wife
She
will
go
to
the
country
Are
you
not
ashamed
to
deprive
us
of
your
charming
wife
Andre
said
his
wife
addressing
her
husband
in
the
same
coquettish
manner
in
which
she
spoke
to
other
men
the
vicomte
has
been
telling
us
such
a
tale
about
Mademoiselle
George
and
Buonaparte
Prince
Andrew
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
turned
away
Pierre
who
from
the
moment
Prince
Andrew
entered
the
room
had
watched
him
with
glad
affectionate
eyes
now
came
up
and
took
his
arm
Before
he
looked
round
Prince
Andrew
frowned
again
expressing
his
annoyance
with
whoever
was
touching
his
arm
but
when
he
saw
Pierre
s
beaming
face
he
gave
him
an
unexpectedly
kind
and
pleasant
smile
There
now
So
you
too
are
in
the
great
world
said
he
to
Pierre
I
knew
you
would
be
here
replied
Pierre
I
will
come
to
supper
with
you
May
I
he
added
in
a
low
voice
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
vicomte
who
was
continuing
his
story
No
impossible
said
Prince
Andrew
laughing
and
pressing
Pierre
s
hand
to
show
that
there
was
no
need
to
ask
the
question
He
wished
to
say
something
more
but
at
that
moment
Prince
Vasili
and
his
daughter
got
up
to
go
and
the
two
young
men
rose
to
let
them
pass
You
must
excuse
me
dear
Vicomte
said
Prince
Vasili
to
the
Frenchman
holding
him
down
by
the
sleeve
in
a
friendly
way
to
prevent
his
rising
This
unfortunate
fete
at
the
ambassador
s
deprives
me
of
a
pleasure
and
obliges
me
to
interrupt
you
I
am
very
sorry
to
leave
your
enchanting
party
said
he
turning
to
Anna
Pavlovna
His
daughter
Princess
Helene
passed
between
the
chairs
lightly
holding
up
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
the
smile
shone
still
more
radiantly
on
her
beautiful
face
Pierre
gazed
at
her
with
rapturous
almost
frightened
eyes
as
she
passed
him
Very
lovely
said
Prince
Andrew
Very
said
Pierre
In
passing
Prince
Vasili
seized
Pierre
s
hand
and
said
to
Anna
Pavlovna
Educate
this
bear
for
me
He
has
been
staying
with
me
a
whole
month
and
this
is
the
first
time
I
have
seen
him
in
society
Nothing
is
so
necessary
for
a
young
man
as
the
society
of
clever
women
Anna
Pavlovna
smiled
and
promised
to
take
Pierre
in
hand
She
knew
his
father
to
be
a
connection
of
Prince
Vasili
s
The
elderly
lady
who
had
been
sitting
with
the
old
aunt
rose
hurriedly
and
overtook
Prince
Vasili
in
the
anteroom
All
the
affectation
of
interest
she
had
assumed
had
left
her
kindly
and
tear
worn
face
and
it
now
expressed
only
anxiety
and
fear
How
about
my
son
Boris
Prince
said
she
hurrying
after
him
into
the
anteroom
I
can
t
remain
any
longer
in
Petersburg
Tell
me
what
news
I
may
take
back
to
my
poor
boy
Although
Prince
Vasili
listened
reluctantly
and
not
very
politely
to
the
elderly
lady
even
betraying
some
impatience
she
gave
him
an
ingratiating
and
appealing
smile
and
took
his
hand
that
he
might
not
go
away
What
would
it
cost
you
to
say
a
word
to
the
Emperor
and
then
he
would
be
transferred
to
the
Guards
at
once
said
she
Believe
me
Princess
I
am
ready
to
do
all
I
can
answered
Prince
Vasili
but
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
ask
the
Emperor
I
should
advise
you
to
appeal
to
Rumyantsev
through
Prince
Golitsyn
That
would
be
the
best
way
The
elderly
lady
was
a
Princess
Drubetskaya
belonging
to
one
of
the
best
families
in
Russia
but
she
was
poor
and
having
long
been
out
of
society
had
lost
her
former
influential
connections
She
had
now
come
to
Petersburg
to
procure
an
appointment
in
the
Guards
for
her
only
son
It
was
in
fact
solely
to
meet
Prince
Vasili
that
she
had
obtained
an
invitation
to
Anna
Pavlovna
s
reception
and
had
sat
listening
to
the
vicomte
s
story
Prince
Vasili
s
words
frightened
her
an
embittered
look
clouded
her
once
handsome
face
but
only
for
a
moment
then
she
smiled
again
and
clutched
Prince
Vasili
s
arm
more
tightly
Listen
to
me
Prince
said
she
I
have
never
yet
asked
you
for
anything
and
I
never
will
again
nor
have
I
ever
reminded
you
of
my
father
s
friendship
for
you
but
now
I
entreat
you
for
God
s
sake
to
do
this
for
my
son
and
I
shall
always
regard
you
as
a
benefactor
she
added
hurriedly
No
don
t
be
angry
but
promise
I
have
asked
Golitsyn
and
he
has
refused
Be
the
kindhearted
man
you
always
were
she
said
trying
to
smile
though
tears
were
in
her
eyes
Papa
we
shall
be
late
said
Princess
Helene
turning
her
beautiful
head
and
looking
over
her
classically
molded
shoulder
as
she
stood
waiting
by
the
door
Influence
in
society
however
is
a
capital
which
has
to
be
economized
if
it
is
to
last
Prince
Vasili
knew
this
and
having
once
realized
that
if
he
asked
on
behalf
of
all
who
begged
of
him
he
would
soon
be
unable
to
ask
for
himself
he
became
chary
of
using
his
influence
But
in
Princess
Drubetskaya
s
case
he
felt
after
her
second
appeal
something
like
qualms
of
conscience
She
had
reminded
him
of
what
was
quite
true
he
had
been
indebted
to
her
father
for
the
first
steps
in
his
career
Moreover
he
could
see
by
her
manners
that
she
was
one
of
those
women
mostly
mothers
who
having
once
made
up
their
minds
will
not
rest
until
they
have
gained
their
end
and
are
prepared
if
necessary
to
go
on
insisting
day
after
day
and
hour
after
hour
and
even
to
make
scenes
This
last
consideration
moved
him
My
dear
Anna
Mikhaylovna
said
he
with
his
usual
familiarity
and
weariness
of
tone
it
is
almost
impossible
for
me
to
do
what
you
ask
but
to
prove
my
devotion
to
you
and
how
I
respect
your
father
s
memory
I
will
do
the
impossible
your
son
shall
be
transferred
to
the
Guards
Here
is
my
hand
on
it
Are
you
satisfied
My
dear
benefactor
This
is
what
I
expected
from
you
I
knew
your
kindness
He
turned
to
go
Wait
just
a
word
When
he
has
been
transferred
to
the
Guards
she
faltered
You
are
on
good
terms
with
Michael
Ilarionovich
Kutuzov
recommend
Boris
to
him
as
adjutant
Then
I
shall
be
at
rest
and
then
Prince
Vasili
smiled
No
I
won
t
promise
that
You
don
t
know
how
Kutuzov
is
pestered
since
his
appointment
as
Commander
in
Chief
He
told
me
himself
that
all
the
Moscow
ladies
have
conspired
to
give
him
all
their
sons
as
adjutants
No
but
do
promise
I
won
t
let
you
go
My
dear
benefactor
Papa
said
his
beautiful
daughter
in
the
same
tone
as
before
we
shall
be
late
Well
au
revoir
Good
bye
You
hear
her
Then
tomorrow
you
will
speak
to
the
Emperor
Certainly
but
about
Kutuzov
I
don
t
promise
Do
promise
do
promise
Vasili
cried
Anna
Mikhaylovna
as
he
went
with
the
smile
of
a
coquettish
girl
which
at
one
time
probably
came
naturally
to
her
but
was
now
very
ill
suited
to
her
careworn
face
Apparently
she
had
forgotten
her
age
and
by
force
of
habit
employed
all
the
old
feminine
arts
But
as
soon
as
the
prince
had
gone
her
face
resumed
its
former
cold
artificial
expression
She
returned
to
the
group
where
the
vicomte
was
still
talking
and
again
pretended
to
listen
while
waiting
till
it
would
be
time
to
leave
Her
task
was
accomplished
And
what
do
you
think
of
this
latest
comedy
the
coronation
at
Milan
asked
Anna
Pavlovna
and
of
the
comedy
of
the
people
of
Genoa
and
Lucca
laying
their
petitions
before
Monsieur
Buonaparte
and
Monsieur
Buonaparte
sitting
on
a
throne
and
granting
the
petitions
of
the
nations
Adorable
It
is
enough
to
make
one
s
head
whirl
It
is
as
if
the
whole
world
had
gone
crazy
Prince
Andrew
looked
Anna
Pavlovna
straight
in
the
face
with
a
sarcastic
smile
Dieu
me
la
donne
gare
a
qui
la
touche
They
say
he
was
very
fine
when
he
said
that
he
remarked
repeating
the
words
in
Italian
Dio
mi
l
ha
dato
Guai
a
chi
la
tocchi
God
has
given
it
to
me
let
him
who
touches
it
beware
I
hope
this
will
prove
the
last
drop
that
will
make
the
glass
run
over
Anna
Pavlovna
continued
The
sovereigns
will
not
be
able
to
endure
this
man
who
is
a
menace
to
everything
The
sovereigns
I
do
not
speak
of
Russia
said
the
vicomte
polite
but
hopeless
The
sovereigns
madame
What
have
they
done
for
Louis
XVII
for
the
Queen
or
for
Madame
Elizabeth
Nothing
and
he
became
more
animated
And
believe
me
they
are
reaping
the
reward
of
their
betrayal
of
the
Bourbon
cause
The
sovereigns
Why
they
are
sending
ambassadors
to
compliment
the
usurper
And
sighing
disdainfully
he
again
changed
his
position
Prince
Hippolyte
who
had
been
gazing
at
the
vicomte
for
some
time
through
his
lorgnette
suddenly
turned
completely
round
toward
the
little
princess
and
having
asked
for
a
needle
began
tracing
the
Conde
coat
of
arms
on
the
table
He
explained
this
to
her
with
as
much
gravity
as
if
she
had
asked
him
to
do
it
Baton
de
gueules
engrele
de
gueules
d
azur
maison
Conde
said
he
The
princess
listened
smiling
If
Buonaparte
remains
on
the
throne
of
France
a
year
longer
the
vicomte
continued
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
in
a
matter
with
which
he
is
better
acquainted
than
anyone
else
does
not
listen
to
others
but
follows
the
current
of
his
own
thoughts
things
will
have
gone
too
far
By
intrigues
violence
exile
and
executions
French
society
I
mean
good
French
society
will
have
been
forever
destroyed
and
then
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
hands
Pierre
wished
to
make
a
remark
for
the
conversation
interested
him
but
Anna
Pavlovna
who
had
him
under
observation
interrupted
The
Emperor
Alexander
said
she
with
the
melancholy
which
always
accompanied
any
reference
of
hers
to
the
Imperial
family
has
declared
that
he
will
leave
it
to
the
French
people
themselves
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
and
I
believe
that
once
free
from
the
usurper
the
whole
nation
will
certainly
throw
itself
into
the
arms
of
its
rightful
king
she
concluded
trying
to
be
amiable
to
the
royalist
emigrant
That
is
doubtful
said
Prince
Andrew
Monsieur
le
Vicomte
quite
rightly
supposes
that
matters
have
already
gone
too
far
I
think
it
will
be
difficult
to
return
to
the
old
regime
From
what
I
have
heard
said
Pierre
blushing
and
breaking
into
the
conversation
almost
all
the
aristocracy
has
already
gone
over
to
Bonaparte
s
side
It
is
the
Buonapartists
who
say
that
replied
the
vicomte
without
looking
at
Pierre
At
the
present
time
it
is
difficult
to
know
the
real
state
of
French
public
opinion
Bonaparte
has
said
so
remarked
Prince
Andrew
with
a
sarcastic
smile
It
was
evident
that
he
did
not
like
the
vicomte
and
was
aiming
his
remarks
at
him
though
without
looking
at
him
I
showed
them
the
path
to
glory
but
they
did
not
follow
it
Prince
Andrew
continued
after
a
short
silence
again
quoting
Napoleon
s
words
I
opened
my
antechambers
and
they
crowded
in
I
do
not
know
how
far
he
was
justified
in
saying
so
Not
in
the
least
replied
the
vicomte
After
the
murder
of
the
duc
even
the
most
partial
ceased
to
regard
him
as
a
hero
If
to
some
people
he
went
on
turning
to
Anna
Pavlovna
he
ever
was
a
hero
after
the
murder
of
the
duc
there
was
one
martyr
more
in
heaven
and
one
hero
less
on
earth
Before
Anna
Pavlovna
and
the
others
had
time
to
smile
their
appreciation
of
the
vicomte
s
epigram
Pierre
again
broke
into
the
conversation
and
though
Anna
Pavlovna
felt
sure
he
would
say
something
inappropriate
she
was
unable
to
stop
him
The
execution
of
the
Duc
d
Enghien
declared
Monsieur
Pierre
was
a
political
necessity
and
it
seems
to
me
that
Napoleon
showed
greatness
of
soul
by
not
fearing
to
take
on
himself
the
whole
responsibility
of
that
deed
Dieu
Mon
Dieu
muttered
Anna
Pavlovna
in
a
terrified
whisper
What
Monsieur
Pierre
Do
you
consider
that
assassination
shows
greatness
of
soul
said
the
little
princess
smiling
and
drawing
her
work
nearer
to
her
Oh
Oh
exclaimed
several
voices
Capital
said
Prince
Hippolyte
in
English
and
began
slapping
his
knee
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
The
vicomte
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
Pierre
looked
solemnly
at
his
audience
over
his
spectacles
and
continued
I
say
so
he
continued
desperately
because
the
Bourbons
fled
from
the
Revolution
leaving
the
people
to
anarchy
and
Napoleon
alone
understood
the
Revolution
and
quelled
it
and
so
for
the
general
good
he
could
not
stop
short
for
the
sake
of
one
man
s
life
Won
t
you
come
over
to
the
other
table
suggested
Anna
Pavlovna
But
Pierre
continued
his
speech
without
heeding
her
No
cried
he
becoming
more
and
more
eager
Napoleon
is
great
because
he
rose
superior
to
the
Revolution
suppressed
its
abuses
preserved
all
that
was
good
in
it
equality
of
citizenship
and
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press
and
only
for
that
reason
did
he
obtain
power
Yes
if
having
obtained
power
without
availing
himself
of
it
to
commit
murder
he
had
restored
it
to
the
rightful
king
I
should
have
called
him
a
great
man
remarked
the
vicomte
He
could
not
do
that
The
people
only
gave
him
power
that
he
might
rid
them
of
the
Bourbons
and
because
they
saw
that
he
was
a
great
man
The
Revolution
was
a
grand
thing
continued
Monsieur
Pierre
betraying
by
this
desperate
and
provocative
proposition
his
extreme
youth
and
his
wish
to
express
all
that
was
in
his
mind
What
Revolution
and
regicide
a
grand
thing
Well
after
that
But
won
t
you
come
to
this
other
table
repeated
Anna
Pavlovna
Rousseau
s
Contrat
Social
said
the
vicomte
with
a
tolerant
smile
I
am
not
speaking
of
regicide
I
am
speaking
about
ideas
Yes
ideas
of
robbery
murder
and
regicide
again
interjected
an
ironical
voice
Those
were
extremes
no
doubt
but
they
are
not
what
is
most
important
What
is
important
are
the
rights
of
man
emancipation
from
prejudices
and
equality
of
citizenship
and
all
these
ideas
Napoleon
has
retained
in
full
force
Liberty
and
equality
said
the
vicomte
contemptuously
as
if
at
last
deciding
seriously
to
prove
to
this
youth
how
foolish
his
words
were
high
sounding
words
which
have
long
been
discredited
Who
does
not
love
liberty
and
equality
Even
our
Saviour
preached
liberty
and
equality
Have
people
since
the
Revolution
become
happier
On
the
contrary
We
wanted
liberty
but
Buonaparte
has
destroyed
it
Prince
Andrew
kept
looking
with
an
amused
smile
from
Pierre
to
the
vicomte
and
from
the
vicomte
to
their
hostess
In
the
first
moment
of
Pierre
s
outburst
Anna
Pavlovna
despite
her
social
experience
was
horror
struck
But
when
she
saw
that
Pierre
s
sacrilegious
words
had
not
exasperated
the
vicomte
and
had
convinced
herself
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
him
she
rallied
her
forces
and
joined
the
vicomte
in
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
orator
But
my
dear
Monsieur
Pierre
said
she
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
of
a
great
man
executing
a
duc
or
even
an
ordinary
man
who
is
innocent
and
untried
I
should
like
said
the
vicomte
to
ask
how
monsieur
explains
the
th
Brumaire
was
not
that
an
imposture
It
was
a
swindle
and
not
at
all
like
the
conduct
of
a
great
man
And
the
prisoners
he
killed
in
Africa
That
was
horrible
said
the
little
princess
shrugging
her
shoulders
He
s
a
low
fellow
say
what
you
will
remarked
Prince
Hippolyte
Pierre
not
knowing
whom
to
answer
looked
at
them
all
and
smiled
His
smile
was
unlike
the
half
smile
of
other
people
When
he
smiled
his
grave
even
rather
gloomy
look
was
instantaneously
replaced
by
another
a
childlike
kindly
even
rather
silly
look
which
seemed
to
ask
forgiveness
The
vicomte
who
was
meeting
him
for
the
first
time
saw
clearly
that
this
young
Jacobin
was
not
so
terrible
as
his
words
suggested
All
were
silent
How
do
you
expect
him
to
answer
you
all
at
once
said
Prince
Andrew
Besides
in
the
actions
of
a
statesman
one
has
to
distinguish
between
his
acts
as
a
private
person
as
a
general
and
as
an
emperor
So
it
seems
to
me
Yes
yes
of
course
Pierre
chimed
in
pleased
at
the
arrival
of
this
reinforcement
One
must
admit
continued
Prince
Andrew
that
Napoleon
as
a
man
was
great
on
the
bridge
of
Arcola
and
in
the
hospital
at
Jaffa
where
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
plague
stricken
but
but
there
are
other
acts
which
it
is
difficult
to
justify
Prince
Andrew
who
had
evidently
wished
to
tone
down
the
awkwardness
of
Pierre
s
remarks
rose
and
made
a
sign
to
his
wife
that
it
was
time
to
go
Suddenly
Prince
Hippolyte
started
up
making
signs
to
everyone
to
attend
and
asking
them
all
to
be
seated
began
I
was
told
a
charming
Moscow
story
today
and
must
treat
you
to
it
Excuse
me
Vicomte
I
must
tell
it
in
Russian
or
the
point
will
be
lost
And
Prince
Hippolyte
began
to
tell
his
story
in
such
Russian
as
a
Frenchman
would
speak
after
spending
about
a
year
in
Russia
Everyone
waited
so
emphatically
and
eagerly
did
he
demand
their
attention
to
his
story
There
is
in
Moscow
a
lady
une
dame
and
she
is
very
stingy
She
must
have
two
footmen
behind
her
carriage
and
very
big
ones
That
was
her
taste
And
she
had
a
lady
s
maid
also
big
She
said
Here
Prince
Hippolyte
paused
evidently
collecting
his
ideas
with
difficulty
She
said
Oh
yes
She
said
Girl
to
the
maid
put
on
a
livery
get
up
behind
the
carriage
and
come
with
me
while
I
make
some
calls
Here
Prince
Hippolyte
spluttered
and
burst
out
laughing
long
before
his
audience
which
produced
an
effect
unfavorable
to
the
narrator
Several
persons
among
them
the
elderly
lady
and
Anna
Pavlovna
did
however
smile
She
went
Suddenly
there
was
a
great
wind
The
girl
lost
her
hat
and
her
long
hair
came
down
Here
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
went
on
between
gasps
of
laughter
And
the
whole
world
knew
And
so
the
anecdote
ended
Though
it
was
unintelligible
why
he
had
told
it
or
why
it
had
to
be
told
in
Russian
still
Anna
Pavlovna
and
the
others
appreciated
Prince
Hippolyte
s
social
tact
in
so
agreeably
ending
Pierre
s
unpleasant
and
unamiable
outburst
After
the
anecdote
the
conversation
broke
up
into
insignificant
small
talk
about
the
last
and
next
balls
about
theatricals
and
who
would
meet
whom
and
when
and
where
Having
thanked
Anna
Pavlovna
for
her
charming
soiree
the
guests
began
to
take
their
leave
Pierre
was
ungainly
Stout
about
the
average
height
broad
with
huge
red
hands
he
did
not
know
as
the
saying
is
how
to
enter
a
drawing
room
and
still
less
how
to
leave
one
that
is
how
to
say
something
particularly
agreeable
before
going
away
Besides
this
he
was
absent
minded
When
he
rose
to
go
he
took
up
instead
of
his
own
the
general
s
three
cornered
hat
and
held
it
pulling
at
the
plume
till
the
general
asked
him
to
restore
it
All
his
absent
mindedness
and
inability
to
enter
a
room
and
converse
in
it
was
however
redeemed
by
his
kindly
simple
and
modest
expression
Anna
Pavlovna
turned
toward
him
and
with
a
Christian
mildness
that
expressed
forgiveness
of
his
indiscretion
nodded
and
said
I
hope
to
see
you
again
but
I
also
hope
you
will
change
your
opinions
my
dear
Monsieur
Pierre
When
she
said
this
he
did
not
reply
and
only
bowed
but
again
everybody
saw
his
smile
which
said
nothing
unless
perhaps
Opinions
are
opinions
but
you
see
what
a
capital
good
natured
fellow
I
am
And
everyone
including
Anna
Pavlovna
felt
this
Prince
Andrew
had
gone
out
into
the
hall
and
turning
his
shoulders
to
the
footman
who
was
helping
him
on
with
his
cloak
listened
indifferently
to
his
wife
s
chatter
with
Prince
Hippolyte
who
had
also
come
into
the
hall
Prince
Hippolyte
stood
close
to
the
pretty
pregnant
princess
and
stared
fixedly
at
her
through
his
eyeglass
Go
in
Annette
or
you
will
catch
cold
said
the
little
princess
taking
leave
of
Anna
Pavlovna
It
is
settled
she
added
in
a
low
voice
Anna
Pavlovna
had
already
managed
to
speak
to
Lise
about
the
match
she
contemplated
between
Anatole
and
the
little
princess
sister
in
law
I
rely
on
you
my
dear
said
Anna
Pavlovna
also
in
a
low
tone
Write
to
her
and
let
me
know
how
her
father
looks
at
the
matter
Au
revoir
and
she
left
the
hall
Prince
Hippolyte
approached
the
little
princess
and
bending
his
face
close
to
her
began
to
whisper
something
Two
footmen
the
princess
and
his
own
stood
holding
a
shawl
and
a
cloak
waiting
for
the
conversation
to
finish
They
listened
to
the
French
sentences
which
to
them
were
meaningless
with
an
air
of
understanding
but
not
wishing
to
appear
to
do
so
The
princess
as
usual
spoke
smilingly
and
listened
with
a
laugh
I
am
very
glad
I
did
not
go
to
the
ambassador
s
said
Prince
Hippolyte
so
dull
It
has
been
a
delightful
evening
has
it
not
Delightful
They
say
the
ball
will
be
very
good
replied
the
princess
drawing
up
her
downy
little
lip
All
the
pretty
women
in
society
will
be
there
Not
all
for
you
will
not
be
there
not
all
said
Prince
Hippolyte
smiling
joyfully
and
snatching
the
shawl
from
the
footman
whom
he
even
pushed
aside
he
began
wrapping
it
round
the
princess
Either
from
awkwardness
or
intentionally
no
one
could
have
said
which
after
the
shawl
had
been
adjusted
he
kept
his
arm
around
her
for
a
long
time
as
though
embracing
her
Still
smiling
she
gracefully
moved
away
turning
and
glancing
at
her
husband
Prince
Andrew
s
eyes
were
closed
so
weary
and
sleepy
did
he
seem
Are
you
ready
he
asked
his
wife
looking
past
her
Prince
Hippolyte
hurriedly
put
on
his
cloak
which
in
the
latest
fashion
reached
to
his
very
heels
and
stumbling
in
it
ran
out
into
the
porch
following
the
princess
whom
a
footman
was
helping
into
the
carriage
Princesse
au
revoir
cried
he
stumbling
with
his
tongue
as
well
as
with
his
feet
The
princess
picking
up
her
dress
was
taking
her
seat
in
the
dark
carriage
her
husband
was
adjusting
his
saber
Prince
Hippolyte
under
pretense
of
helping
was
in
everyone
s
way
Allow
me
sir
said
Prince
Andrew
in
Russian
in
a
cold
disagreeable
tone
to
Prince
Hippolyte
who
was
blocking
his
path
I
am
expecting
you
Pierre
said
the
same
voice
but
gently
and
affectionately
The
postilion
started
the
carriage
wheels
rattled
Prince
Hippolyte
laughed
spasmodically
as
he
stood
in
the
porch
waiting
for
the
vicomte
whom
he
had
promised
to
take
home
Well
mon
cher
said
the
vicomte
having
seated
himself
beside
Hippolyte
in
the
carriage
your
little
princess
is
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
quite
French
and
he
kissed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
Hippolyte
burst
out
laughing
Do
you
know
you
are
a
terrible
chap
for
all
your
innocent
airs
continued
the
vicomte
I
pity
the
poor
husband
that
little
officer
who
gives
himself
the
airs
of
a
monarch
Hippolyte
spluttered
again
and
amid
his
laughter
said
And
you
were
saying
that
the
Russian
ladies
are
not
equal
to
the
French
One
has
to
know
how
to
deal
with
them
Pierre
reaching
the
house
first
went
into
Prince
Andrew
s
study
like
one
quite
at
home
and
from
habit
immediately
lay
down
on
the
sofa
took
from
the
shelf
the
first
book
that
came
to
his
hand
it
was
Caesar
s
Commentaries
and
resting
on
his
elbow
began
reading
it
in
the
middle
What
have
you
done
to
Mlle
Scherer
She
will
be
quite
ill
now
said
Prince
Andrew
as
he
entered
the
study
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
Pierre
turned
his
whole
body
making
the
sofa
creak
He
lifted
his
eager
face
to
Prince
Andrew
smiled
and
waved
his
hand
That
abbe
is
very
interesting
but
he
does
not
see
the
thing
in
the
right
light
In
my
opinion
perpetual
peace
is
possible
but
I
do
not
know
how
to
express
it
not
by
a
balance
of
political
power
It
was
evident
that
Prince
Andrew
was
not
interested
in
such
abstract
conversation
One
can
t
everywhere
say
all
one
thinks
mon
cher
Well
have
you
at
last
decided
on
anything
Are
you
going
to
be
a
guardsman
or
a
diplomatist
asked
Prince
Andrew
after
a
momentary
silence
Pierre
sat
up
on
the
sofa
with
his
legs
tucked
under
him
Really
I
don
t
yet
know
I
don
t
like
either
the
one
or
the
other
But
you
must
decide
on
something
Your
father
expects
it
Pierre
at
the
age
of
ten
had
been
sent
abroad
with
an
abbe
as
tutor
and
had
remained
away
till
he
was
twenty
When
he
returned
to
Moscow
his
father
dismissed
the
abbe
and
said
to
the
young
man
Now
go
to
Petersburg
look
round
and
choose
your
profession
I
will
agree
to
anything
Here
is
a
letter
to
Prince
Vasili
and
here
is
money
Write
to
me
all
about
it
and
I
will
help
you
in
everything
Pierre
had
already
been
choosing
a
career
for
three
months
and
had
not
decided
on
anything
It
was
about
this
choice
that
Prince
Andrew
was
speaking
Pierre
rubbed
his
forehead
But
he
must
be
a
Freemason
said
he
referring
to
the
abbe
whom
he
had
met
that
evening
That
is
all
nonsense
Prince
Andrew
again
interrupted
him
let
us
talk
business
Have
you
been
to
the
Horse
Guards
No
I
have
not
but
this
is
what
I
have
been
thinking
and
wanted
to
tell
you
There
is
a
war
now
against
Napoleon
If
it
were
a
war
for
freedom
I
could
understand
it
and
should
be
the
first
to
enter
the
army
but
to
help
England
and
Austria
against
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
is
not
right
Prince
Andrew
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
Pierre
s
childish
words
He
put
on
the
air
of
one
who
finds
it
impossible
to
reply
to
such
nonsense
but
it
would
in
fact
have
been
difficult
to
give
any
other
answer
than
the
one
Prince
Andrew
gave
to
this
naive
question
If
no
one
fought
except
on
his
own
conviction
there
would
be
no
wars
he
said
And
that
would
be
splendid
said
Pierre
Prince
Andrew
smiled
ironically
Very
likely
it
would
be
splendid
but
it
will
never
come
about
Well
why
are
you
going
to
the
war
asked
Pierre
What
for
I
don
t
know
I
must
Besides
that
I
am
going
He
paused
I
am
going
because
the
life
I
am
leading
here
does
not
suit
me
The
rustle
of
a
woman
s
dress
was
heard
in
the
next
room
Prince
Andrew
shook
himself
as
if
waking
up
and
his
face
assumed
the
look
it
had
had
in
Anna
Pavlovna
s
drawing
room
Pierre
removed
his
feet
from
the
sofa
The
princess
came
in
She
had
changed
her
gown
for
a
house
dress
as
fresh
and
elegant
as
the
other
Prince
Andrew
rose
and
politely
placed
a
chair
for
her
How
is
it
she
began
as
usual
in
French
settling
down
briskly
and
fussily
in
the
easy
chair
how
is
it
Annette
never
got
married
How
stupid
you
men
all
are
not
to
have
married
her
Excuse
me
for
saying
so
but
you
have
no
sense
about
women
What
an
argumentative
fellow
you
are
Monsieur
Pierre
And
I
am
still
arguing
with
your
husband
I
can
t
understand
why
he
wants
to
go
to
the
war
replied
Pierre
addressing
the
princess
with
none
of
the
embarrassment
so
commonly
shown
by
young
men
in
their
intercourse
with
young
women
The
princess
started
Evidently
Pierre
s
words
touched
her
to
the
quick
Ah
that
is
just
what
I
tell
him
said
she
I
don
t
understand
it
I
don
t
in
the
least
understand
why
men
can
t
live
without
wars
How
is
it
that
we
women
don
t
want
anything
of
the
kind
don
t
need
it
Now
you
shall
judge
between
us
I
always
tell
him
Here
he
is
Uncle
s
aide
de
camp
a
most
brilliant
position
He
is
so
well
known
so
much
appreciated
by
everyone
The
other
day
at
the
Apraksins
I
heard
a
lady
asking
Is
that
the
famous
Prince
Andrew
I
did
indeed
She
laughed
He
is
so
well
received
everywhere
He
might
easily
become
aide
de
camp
to
the
Emperor
You
know
the
Emperor
spoke
to
him
most
graciously
Annette
and
I
were
speaking
of
how
to
arrange
it
What
do
you
think
Pierre
looked
at
his
friend
and
noticing
that
he
did
not
like
the
conversation
gave
no
reply
When
are
you
starting
he
asked
Oh
don
t
speak
of
his
going
don
t
I
won
t
hear
it
spoken
of
said
the
princess
in
the
same
petulantly
playful
tone
in
which
she
had
spoken
to
Hippolyte
in
the
drawing
room
and
which
was
so
plainly
ill
suited
to
the
family
circle
of
which
Pierre
was
almost
a
member
Today
when
I
remembered
that
all
these
delightful
associations
must
be
broken
off
and
then
you
know
Andre
she
looked
significantly
at
her
husband
I
m
afraid
I
m
afraid
she
whispered
and
a
shudder
ran
down
her
back
Her
husband
looked
at
her
as
if
surprised
to
notice
that
someone
besides
Pierre
and
himself
was
in
the
room
and
addressed
her
in
a
tone
of
frigid
politeness
What
is
it
you
are
afraid
of
Lise
I
don
t
understand
said
he
There
what
egotists
men
all
are
all
all
egotists
Just
for
a
whim
of
his
own
goodness
only
knows
why
he
leaves
me
and
locks
me
up
alone
in
the
country
With
my
father
and
sister
remember
said
Prince
Andrew
gently
Alone
all
the
same
without
my
friends
And
he
expects
me
not
to
be
afraid
Her
tone
was
now
querulous
and
her
lip
drawn
up
giving
her
not
a
joyful
but
an
animal
squirrel
like
expression
She
paused
as
if
she
felt
it
indecorous
to
speak
of
her
pregnancy
before
Pierre
though
the
gist
of
the
matter
lay
in
that
I
still
can
t
understand
what
you
are
afraid
of
said
Prince
Andrew
slowly
not
taking
his
eyes
off
his
wife
The
princess
blushed
and
raised
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
despair
No
Andrew
I
must
say
you
have
changed
Oh
how
you
have
Your
doctor
tells
you
to
go
to
bed
earlier
said
Prince
Andrew
You
had
better
go
The
princess
said
nothing
but
suddenly
her
short
downy
lip
quivered
Prince
Andrew
rose
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
about
the
room
Pierre
looked
over
his
spectacles
with
naive
surprise
now
at
him
and
now
at
her
moved
as
if
about
to
rise
too
but
changed
his
mind
Why
should
I
mind
Monsieur
Pierre
being
here
exclaimed
the
little
princess
suddenly
her
pretty
face
all
at
once
distorted
by
a
tearful
grimace
I
have
long
wanted
to
ask
you
Andrew
why
you
have
changed
so
to
me
What
have
I
done
to
you
You
are
going
to
the
war
and
have
no
pity
for
me
Why
is
it
Lise
was
all
Prince
Andrew
said
But
that
one
word
expressed
an
entreaty
a
threat
and
above
all
conviction
that
she
would
herself
regret
her
words
But
she
went
on
hurriedly
You
treat
me
like
an
invalid
or
a
child
I
see
it
all
Did
you
behave
like
that
six
months
ago
Lise
I
beg
you
to
desist
said
Prince
Andrew
still
more
emphatically
Pierre
who
had
been
growing
more
and
more
agitated
as
he
listened
to
all
this
rose
and
approached
the
princess
He
seemed
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
tears
and
was
ready
to
cry
himself
Calm
yourself
Princess
It
seems
so
to
you
because
I
assure
you
I
myself
have
experienced
and
so
because
No
excuse
me
An
outsider
is
out
of
place
here
No
don
t
distress
yourself
Good
bye
Prince
Andrew
caught
him
by
the
hand
No
wait
Pierre
The
princess
is
too
kind
to
wish
to
deprive
me
of
the
pleasure
of
spending
the
evening
with
you
No
he
thinks
only
of
himself
muttered
the
princess
without
restraining
her
angry
tears
Lise
said
Prince
Andrew
dryly
raising
his
voice
to
the
pitch
which
indicates
that
patience
is
exhausted
Suddenly
the
angry
squirrel
like
expression
of
the
princess
pretty
face
changed
into
a
winning
and
piteous
look
of
fear
Her
beautiful
eyes
glanced
askance
at
her
husband
s
face
and
her
own
assumed
the
timid
deprecating
expression
of
a
dog
when
it
rapidly
but
feebly
wags
its
drooping
tail
Mon
Dieu
mon
Dieu
she
muttered
and
lifting
her
dress
with
one
hand
she
went
up
to
her
husband
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
Good
night
Lise
said
he
rising
and
courteously
kissing
her
hand
as
he
would
have
done
to
a
stranger
The
friends
were
silent
Neither
cared
to
begin
talking
Pierre
continually
glanced
at
Prince
Andrew
Prince
Andrew
rubbed
his
forehead
with
his
small
hand
Let
us
go
and
have
supper
he
said
with
a
sigh
going
to
the
door
They
entered
the
elegant
newly
decorated
and
luxurious
dining
room
Everything
from
the
table
napkins
to
the
silver
china
and
glass
bore
that
imprint
of
newness
found
in
the
households
of
the
newly
married
Halfway
through
supper
Prince
Andrew
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
with
a
look
of
nervous
agitation
such
as
Pierre
had
never
before
seen
on
his
face
began
to
talk
as
one
who
has
long
had
something
on
his
mind
and
suddenly
determines
to
speak
out
Never
never
marry
my
dear
fellow
That
s
my
advice
never
marry
till
you
can
say
to
yourself
that
you
have
done
all
you
are
capable
of
and
until
you
have
ceased
to
love
the
woman
of
your
choice
and
have
seen
her
plainly
as
she
is
or
else
you
will
make
a
cruel
and
irrevocable
mistake
Marry
when
you
are
old
and
good
for
nothing
or
all
that
is
good
and
noble
in
you
will
be
lost
It
will
all
be
wasted
on
trifles
Yes
Yes
Yes
Don
t
look
at
me
with
such
surprise
If
you
marry
expecting
anything
from
yourself
in
the
future
you
will
feel
at
every
step
that
for
you
all
is
ended
all
is
closed
except
the
drawing
room
where
you
will
be
ranged
side
by
side
with
a
court
lackey
and
an
idiot
But
what
s
the
good
and
he
waved
his
arm
Pierre
took
off
his
spectacles
which
made
his
face
seem
different
and
the
good
natured
expression
still
more
apparent
and
gazed
at
his
friend
in
amazement
My
wife
continued
Prince
Andrew
is
an
excellent
woman
one
of
those
rare
women
with
whom
a
man
s
honor
is
safe
but
O
God
what
would
I
not
give
now
to
be
unmarried
You
are
the
first
and
only
one
to
whom
I
mention
this
because
I
like
you
As
he
said
this
Prince
Andrew
was
less
than
ever
like
that
Bolkonski
who
had
lolled
in
Anna
Pavlovna
s
easy
chairs
and
with
half
closed
eyes
had
uttered
French
phrases
between
his
teeth
Every
muscle
of
his
thin
face
was
now
quivering
with
nervous
excitement
his
eyes
in
which
the
fire
of
life
had
seemed
extinguished
now
flashed
with
brilliant
light
It
was
evident
that
the
more
lifeless
he
seemed
at
ordinary
times
the
more
impassioned
he
became
in
these
moments
of
almost
morbid
irritation
You
don
t
understand
why
I
say
this
he
continued
but
it
is
the
whole
story
of
life
You
talk
of
Bonaparte
and
his
career
said
he
though
Pierre
had
not
mentioned
Bonaparte
but
Bonaparte
when
he
worked
went
step
by
step
toward
his
goal
He
was
free
he
had
nothing
but
his
aim
to
consider
and
he
reached
it
But
tie
yourself
up
with
a
woman
and
like
a
chained
convict
you
lose
all
freedom
And
all
you
have
of
hope
and
strength
merely
weighs
you
down
and
torments
you
with
regret
Drawing
rooms
gossip
balls
vanity
and
triviality
these
are
the
enchanted
circle
I
cannot
escape
from
I
am
now
going
to
the
war
the
greatest
war
there
ever
was
and
I
know
nothing
and
am
fit
for
nothing
I
am
very
amiable
and
have
a
caustic
wit
continued
Prince
Andrew
and
at
Anna
Pavlovna
s
they
listen
to
me
And
that
stupid
set
without
whom
my
wife
cannot
exist
and
those
women
If
you
only
knew
what
those
society
women
are
and
women
in
general
My
father
is
right
Selfish
vain
stupid
trivial
in
everything
that
s
what
women
are
when
you
see
them
in
their
true
colors
When
you
meet
them
in
society
it
seems
as
if
there
were
something
in
them
but
there
s
nothing
nothing
nothing
No
don
t
marry
my
dear
fellow
don
t
marry
concluded
Prince
Andrew
It
seems
funny
to
me
said
Pierre
that
you
you
should
consider
yourself
incapable
and
your
life
a
spoiled
life
You
have
everything
before
you
everything
And
you
He
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
his
tone
showed
how
highly
he
thought
of
his
friend
and
how
much
he
expected
of
him
in
the
future
How
can
he
talk
like
that
thought
Pierre
He
considered
his
friend
a
model
of
perfection
because
Prince
Andrew
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
just
the
very
qualities
Pierre
lacked
and
which
might
be
best
described
as
strength
of
will
Pierre
was
always
astonished
at
Prince
Andrew
s
calm
manner
of
treating
everybody
his
extraordinary
memory
his
extensive
reading
he
had
read
everything
knew
everything
and
had
an
opinion
about
everything
but
above
all
at
his
capacity
for
work
and
study
And
if
Pierre
was
often
struck
by
Andrew
s
lack
of
capacity
for
philosophical
meditation
to
which
he
himself
was
particularly
addicted
he
regarded
even
this
not
as
a
defect
but
as
a
sign
of
strength
Even
in
the
best
most
friendly
and
simplest
relations
of
life
praise
and
commendation
are
essential
just
as
grease
is
necessary
to
wheels
that
they
may
run
smoothly
My
part
is
played
out
said
Prince
Andrew
What
s
the
use
of
talking
about
me
Let
us
talk
about
you
he
added
after
a
silence
smiling
at
his
reassuring
thoughts
That
smile
was
immediately
reflected
on
Pierre
s
face
But
what
is
there
to
say
about
me
said
Pierre
his
face
relaxing
into
a
careless
merry
smile
What
am
I
An
illegitimate
son
He
suddenly
blushed
crimson
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
made
a
great
effort
to
say
this
Without
a
name
and
without
means
And
it
really
But
he
did
not
say
what
it
really
was
For
the
present
I
am
free
and
am
all
right
Only
I
haven
t
the
least
idea
what
I
am
to
do
I
wanted
to
consult
you
seriously
Prince
Andrew
looked
kindly
at
him
yet
his
glance
friendly
and
affectionate
as
it
was
expressed
a
sense
of
his
own
superiority
I
am
fond
of
you
especially
as
you
are
the
one
live
man
among
our
whole
set
Yes
you
re
all
right
Choose
what
you
will
it
s
all
the
same
You
ll
be
all
right
anywhere
But
look
here
give
up
visiting
those
Kuragins
and
leading
that
sort
of
life
It
suits
you
so
badly
all
this
debauchery
dissipation
and
the
rest
of
it
What
would
you
have
my
dear
fellow
answered
Pierre
shrugging
his
shoulders
Women
my
dear
fellow
women
I
don
t
understand
it
replied
Prince
Andrew
Women
who
are
comme
il
faut
that
s
a
different
matter
but
the
Kuragins
set
of
women
women
and
wine
I
don
t
understand
Pierre
was
staying
at
Prince
Vasili
Kuragin
s
and
sharing
the
dissipated
life
of
his
son
Anatole
the
son
whom
they
were
planning
to
reform
by
marrying
him
to
Prince
Andrew
s
sister
Do
you
know
said
Pierre
as
if
suddenly
struck
by
a
happy
thought
seriously
I
have
long
been
thinking
of
it
Leading
such
a
life
I
can
t
decide
or
think
properly
about
anything
One
s
head
aches
and
one
spends
all
one
s
money
He
asked
me
for
tonight
but
I
won
t
go
You
give
me
your
word
of
honor
not
to
go
On
my
honor
It
was
past
one
o
clock
when
Pierre
left
his
friend
It
was
a
cloudless
northern
summer
night
Pierre
took
an
open
cab
intending
to
drive
straight
home
But
the
nearer
he
drew
to
the
house
the
more
he
felt
the
impossibility
of
going
to
sleep
on
such
a
night
It
was
light
enough
to
see
a
long
way
in
the
deserted
street
and
it
seemed
more
like
morning
or
evening
than
night
On
the
way
Pierre
remembered
that
Anatole
Kuragin
was
expecting
the
usual
set
for
cards
that
evening
after
which
there
was
generally
a
drinking
bout
finishing
with
visits
of
a
kind
Pierre
was
very
fond
of
I
should
like
to
go
to
Kuragin
s
thought
he
But
he
immediately
recalled
his
promise
to
Prince
Andrew
not
to
go
there
Then
as
happens
to
people
of
weak
character
he
desired
so
passionately
once
more
to
enjoy
that
dissipation
he
was
so
accustomed
to
that
he
decided
to
go
The
thought
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
his
promise
to
Prince
Andrew
was
of
no
account
because
before
he
gave
it
he
had
already
promised
Prince
Anatole
to
come
to
his
gathering
besides
thought
he
all
such
words
of
honor
are
conventional
things
with
no
definite
meaning
especially
if
one
considers
that
by
tomorrow
one
may
be
dead
or
something
so
extraordinary
may
happen
to
one
that
honor
and
dishonor
will
be
all
the
same
Pierre
often
indulged
in
reflections
of
this
sort
nullifying
all
his
decisions
and
intentions
He
went
to
Kuragin
s
Reaching
the
large
house
near
the
Horse
Guards
barracks
in
which
Anatole
lived
Pierre
entered
the
lighted
porch
ascended
the
stairs
and
went
in
at
the
open
door
There
was
no
one
in
the
anteroom
empty
bottles
cloaks
and
overshoes
were
lying
about
there
was
a
smell
of
alcohol
and
sounds
of
voices
and
shouting
in
the
distance
Cards
and
supper
were
over
but
the
visitors
had
not
yet
dispersed
Pierre
threw
off
his
cloak
and
entered
the
first
room
in
which
were
the
remains
of
supper
A
footman
thinking
no
one
saw
him
was
drinking
on
the
sly
what
was
left
in
the
glasses
From
the
third
room
came
sounds
of
laughter
the
shouting
of
familiar
voices
the
growling
of
a
bear
and
general
commotion
Some
eight
or
nine
young
men
were
crowding
anxiously
round
an
open
window
Three
others
were
romping
with
a
young
bear
one
pulling
him
by
the
chain
and
trying
to
set
him
at
the
others
I
bet
a
hundred
on
Stevens
shouted
one
Mind
no
holding
on
cried
another
I
bet
on
Dolokhov
cried
a
third
Kuragin
you
part
our
hands
There
leave
Bruin
alone
here
s
a
bet
on
At
one
draught
or
he
loses
shouted
a
fourth
Jacob
bring
a
bottle
shouted
the
host
a
tall
handsome
fellow
who
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
group
without
a
coat
and
with
his
fine
linen
shirt
unfastened
in
front
Wait
a
bit
you
fellows
Here
is
Petya
Good
man
cried
he
addressing
Pierre
Another
voice
from
a
man
of
medium
height
with
clear
blue
eyes
particularly
striking
among
all
these
drunken
voices
by
its
sober
ring
cried
from
the
window
Come
here
part
the
bets
This
was
Dolokhov
an
officer
of
the
Semenov
regiment
a
notorious
gambler
and
duelist
who
was
living
with
Anatole
Pierre
smiled
looking
about
him
merrily
I
don
t
understand
What
s
it
all
about
Wait
a
bit
he
is
not
drunk
yet
A
bottle
here
said
Anatole
taking
a
glass
from
the
table
he
went
up
to
Pierre
First
of
all
you
must
drink
Pierre
drank
one
glass
after
another
looking
from
under
his
brows
at
the
tipsy
guests
who
were
again
crowding
round
the
window
and
listening
to
their
chatter
Anatole
kept
on
refilling
Pierre
s
glass
while
explaining
that
Dolokhov
was
betting
with
Stevens
an
English
naval
officer
that
he
would
drink
a
bottle
of
rum
sitting
on
the
outer
ledge
of
the
third
floor
window
with
his
legs
hanging
out
Go
on
you
must
drink
it
all
said
Anatole
giving
Pierre
the
last
glass
or
I
won
t
let
you
go
No
I
won
t
said
Pierre
pushing
Anatole
aside
and
he
went
up
to
the
window
Dolokhov
was
holding
the
Englishman
s
hand
and
clearly
and
distinctly
repeating
the
terms
of
the
bet
addressing
himself
particularly
to
Anatole
and
Pierre
Dolokhov
was
of
medium
height
with
curly
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
He
was
about
twenty
five
Like
all
infantry
officers
he
wore
no
mustache
so
that
his
mouth
the
most
striking
feature
of
his
face
was
clearly
seen
The
lines
of
that
mouth
were
remarkably
finely
curved
The
middle
of
the
upper
lip
formed
a
sharp
wedge
and
closed
firmly
on
the
firm
lower
one
and
something
like
two
distinct
smiles
played
continually
round
the
two
corners
of
the
mouth
this
together
with
the
resolute
insolent
intelligence
of
his
eyes
produced
an
effect
which
made
it
impossible
not
to
notice
his
face
Dolokhov
was
a
man
of
small
means
and
no
connections
Yet
though
Anatole
spent
tens
of
thousands
of
rubles
Dolokhov
lived
with
him
and
had
placed
himself
on
such
a
footing
that
all
who
knew
them
including
Anatole
himself
respected
him
more
than
they
did
Anatole
Dolokhov
could
play
all
games
and
nearly
always
won
However
much
he
drank
he
never
lost
his
clearheadedness
Both
Kuragin
and
Dolokhov
were
at
that
time
notorious
among
the
rakes
and
scapegraces
of
Petersburg
The
bottle
of
rum
was
brought
The
window
frame
which
prevented
anyone
from
sitting
on
the
outer
sill
was
being
forced
out
by
two
footmen
who
were
evidently
flurried
and
intimidated
by
the
directions
and
shouts
of
the
gentlemen
around
Anatole
with
his
swaggering
air
strode
up
to
the
window
He
wanted
to
smash
something
Pushing
away
the
footmen
he
tugged
at
the
frame
but
could
not
move
it
He
smashed
a
pane
You
have
a
try
Hercules
said
he
turning
to
Pierre
Pierre
seized
the
crossbeam
tugged
and
wrenched
the
oak
frame
out
with
a
crash
Take
it
right
out
or
they
ll
think
I
m
holding
on
said
Dolokhov
Is
the
Englishman
bragging
Eh
Is
it
all
right
said
Anatole
First
rate
said
Pierre
looking
at
Dolokhov
who
with
a
bottle
of
rum
in
his
hand
was
approaching
the
window
from
which
the
light
of
the
sky
the
dawn
merging
with
the
afterglow
of
sunset
was
visible
Dolokhov
the
bottle
of
rum
still
in
his
hand
jumped
onto
the
window
sill
Listen
cried
he
standing
there
and
addressing
those
in
the
room
All
were
silent
I
bet
fifty
imperials
he
spoke
French
that
the
Englishman
might
understand
him
but
he
did
not
speak
it
very
well
I
bet
fifty
imperials
or
do
you
wish
to
make
it
a
hundred
added
he
addressing
the
Englishman
No
fifty
replied
the
latter
All
right
Fifty
imperials
that
I
will
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
rum
without
taking
it
from
my
mouth
sitting
outside
the
window
on
this
spot
he
stooped
and
pointed
to
the
sloping
ledge
outside
the
window
and
without
holding
on
to
anything
Is
that
right
Quite
right
said
the
Englishman
Anatole
turned
to
the
Englishman
and
taking
him
by
one
of
the
buttons
of
his
coat
and
looking
down
at
him
the
Englishman
was
short
began
repeating
the
terms
of
the
wager
to
him
in
English
Wait
cried
Dolokhov
hammering
with
the
bottle
on
the
window
sill
to
attract
attention
Wait
a
bit
Kuragin
Listen
If
anyone
else
does
the
same
I
will
pay
him
a
hundred
imperials
Do
you
understand
The
Englishman
nodded
but
gave
no
indication
whether
he
intended
to
accept
this
challenge
or
not
Anatole
did
not
release
him
and
though
he
kept
nodding
to
show
that
he
understood
Anatole
went
on
translating
Dolokhov
s
words
into
English
A
thin
young
lad
an
hussar
of
the
Life
Guards
who
had
been
losing
that
evening
climbed
on
the
window
sill
leaned
over
and
looked
down
Oh
Oh
Oh
he
muttered
looking
down
from
the
window
at
the
stones
of
the
pavement
Shut
up
cried
Dolokhov
pushing
him
away
from
the
window
The
lad
jumped
awkwardly
back
into
the
room
tripping
over
his
spurs
Placing
the
bottle
on
the
window
sill
where
he
could
reach
it
easily
Dolokhov
climbed
carefully
and
slowly
through
the
window
and
lowered
his
legs
Pressing
against
both
sides
of
the
window
he
adjusted
himself
on
his
seat
lowered
his
hands
moved
a
little
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
and
took
up
the
bottle
Anatole
brought
two
candles
and
placed
them
on
the
window
sill
though
it
was
already
quite
light
Dolokhov
s
back
in
his
white
shirt
and
his
curly
head
were
lit
up
from
both
sides
Everyone
crowded
to
the
window
the
Englishman
in
front
Pierre
stood
smiling
but
silent
One
man
older
than
the
others
present
suddenly
pushed
forward
with
a
scared
and
angry
look
and
wanted
to
seize
hold
of
Dolokhov
s
shirt
I
say
this
is
folly
He
ll
be
killed
said
this
more
sensible
man
Anatole
stopped
him
Don
t
touch
him
You
ll
startle
him
and
then
he
ll
be
killed
Eh
What
then
Eh
Dolokhov
turned
round
and
again
holding
on
with
both
hands
arranged
himself
on
his
seat
If
anyone
comes
meddling
again
said
he
emitting
the
words
separately
through
his
thin
compressed
lips
I
will
throw
him
down
there
Now
then
Saying
this
he
again
turned
round
dropped
his
hands
took
the
bottle
and
lifted
it
to
his
lips
threw
back
his
head
and
raised
his
free
hand
to
balance
himself
One
of
the
footmen
who
had
stooped
to
pick
up
some
broken
glass
remained
in
that
position
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
window
and
from
Dolokhov
s
back
Anatole
stood
erect
with
staring
eyes
The
Englishman
looked
on
sideways
pursing
up
his
lips
The
man
who
had
wished
to
stop
the
affair
ran
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
threw
himself
on
a
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
wall
Pierre
hid
his
face
from
which
a
faint
smile
forgot
to
fade
though
his
features
now
expressed
horror
and
fear
All
were
still
Pierre
took
his
hands
from
his
eyes
Dolokhov
still
sat
in
the
same
position
only
his
head
was
thrown
further
back
till
his
curly
hair
touched
his
shirt
collar
and
the
hand
holding
the
bottle
was
lifted
higher
and
higher
and
trembled
with
the
effort
The
bottle
was
emptying
perceptibly
and
rising
still
higher
and
his
head
tilting
yet
further
back
Why
is
it
so
long
thought
Pierre
It
seemed
to
him
that
more
than
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
Suddenly
Dolokhov
made
a
backward
movement
with
his
spine
and
his
arm
trembled
nervously
this
was
sufficient
to
cause
his
whole
body
to
slip
as
he
sat
on
the
sloping
ledge
As
he
began
slipping
down
his
head
and
arm
wavered
still
more
with
the
strain
One
hand
moved
as
if
to
clutch
the
window
sill
but
refrained
from
touching
it
Pierre
again
covered
his
eyes
and
thought
he
would
never
open
them
again
Suddenly
he
was
aware
of
a
stir
all
around
He
looked
up
Dolokhov
was
standing
on
the
window
sill
with
a
pale
but
radiant
face
It
s
empty
He
threw
the
bottle
to
the
Englishman
who
caught
it
neatly
Dolokhov
jumped
down
He
smelt
strongly
of
rum
Well
done
Fine
fellow
There
s
a
bet
for
you
Devil
take
you
came
from
different
sides
The
Englishman
took
out
his
purse
and
began
counting
out
the
money
Dolokhov
stood
frowning
and
did
not
speak
Pierre
jumped
upon
the
window
sill
Gentlemen
who
wishes
to
bet
with
me
I
ll
do
the
same
thing
he
suddenly
cried
Even
without
a
bet
there
Tell
them
to
bring
me
a
bottle
I
ll
do
it
Bring
a
bottle
Let
him
do
it
let
him
do
it
said
Dolokhov
smiling
What
next
Have
you
gone
mad
No
one
would
let
you
Why
you
go
giddy
even
on
a
staircase
exclaimed
several
voices
I
ll
drink
it
Let
s
have
a
bottle
of
rum
shouted
Pierre
banging
the
table
with
a
determined
and
drunken
gesture
and
preparing
to
climb
out
of
the
window
They
seized
him
by
his
arms
but
he
was
so
strong
that
everyone
who
touched
him
was
sent
flying
No
you
ll
never
manage
him
that
way
said
Anatole
Wait
a
bit
and
I
ll
get
round
him
Listen
I
ll
take
your
bet
tomorrow
but
now
we
are
all
going
to
s
Come
on
then
cried
Pierre
Come
on
And
we
ll
take
Bruin
with
us
And
he
caught
the
bear
took
it
in
his
arms
lifted
it
from
the
ground
and
began
dancing
round
the
room
with
it
Prince
Vasili
kept
the
promise
he
had
given
to
Princess
Drubetskaya
who
had
spoken
to
him
on
behalf
of
her
only
son
Boris
on
the
evening
of
Anna
Pavlovna
s
soiree
The
matter
was
mentioned
to
the
Emperor
an
exception
made
and
Boris
transferred
into
the
regiment
of
Semenov
Guards
with
the
rank
of
cornet
He
received
however
no
appointment
to
Kutuzov
s
staff
despite
all
Anna
Mikhaylovna
s
endeavors
and
entreaties
Soon
after
Anna
Pavlovna
s
reception
Anna
Mikhaylovna
returned
to
Moscow
and
went
straight
to
her
rich
relations
the
Rostovs
with
whom
she
stayed
when
in
the
town
and
where
her
darling
Bory
who
had
only
just
entered
a
regiment
of
the
line
and
was
being
at
once
transferred
to
the
Guards
as
a
cornet
had
been
educated
from
childhood
and
lived
for
years
at
a
time
The
Guards
had
already
left
Petersburg
on
the
tenth
of
August
and
her
son
who
had
remained
in
Moscow
for
his
equipment
was
to
join
them
on
the
march
to
Radzivilov
It
was
St
Natalia
s
day
and
the
name
day
of
two
of
the
Rostovs
the
mother
and
the
youngest
daughter
both
named
Nataly
Ever
since
the
morning
carriages
with
six
horses
had
been
coming
and
going
continually
bringing
visitors
to
the
Countess
Rostova
s
big
house
on
the
Povarskaya
so
well
known
to
all
Moscow
The
countess
herself
and
her
handsome
eldest
daughter
were
in
the
drawing
room
with
the
visitors
who
came
to
congratulate
and
who
constantly
succeeded
one
another
in
relays
The
countess
was
a
woman
of
about
forty
five
with
a
thin
Oriental
type
of
face
evidently
worn
out
with
childbearing
she
had
had
twelve
A
languor
of
motion
and
speech
resulting
from
weakness
gave
her
a
distinguished
air
which
inspired
respect
Princess
Anna
Mikhaylovna
Drubetskaya
who
as
a
member
of
the
household
was
also
seated
in
the
drawing
room
helped
to
receive
and
entertain
the
visitors
The
young
people
were
in
one
of
the
inner
rooms
not
considering
it
necessary
to
take
part
in
receiving
the
visitors
The
count
met
the
guests
and
saw
them
off
inviting
them
all
to
dinner
I
am
very
very
grateful
to
you
mon
cher
or
ma
chere
he
called
everyone
without
exception
and
without
the
slightest
variation
in
his
tone
my
dear
whether
they
were
above
or
below
him
in
rank
I
thank
you
for
myself
and
for
our
two
dear
ones
whose
name
day
we
are
keeping
But
mind
you
come
to
dinner
or
I
shall
be
offended
ma
chere
On
behalf
of
the
whole
family
I
beg
you
to
come
mon
cher
These
words
he
repeated
to
everyone
without
exception
or
variation
and
with
the
same
expression
on
his
full
cheerful
clean
shaven
face
the
same
firm
pressure
of
the
hand
and
the
same
quick
repeated
bows
As
soon
as
he
had
seen
a
visitor
off
he
returned
to
one
of
those
who
were
still
in
the
drawing
room
drew
a
chair
toward
him
or
her
and
jauntily
spreading
out
his
legs
and
putting
his
hands
on
his
knees
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
enjoys
life
and
knows
how
to
live
he
swayed
to
and
fro
with
dignity
offered
surmises
about
the
weather
or
touched
on
questions
of
health
sometimes
in
Russian
and
sometimes
in
very
bad
but
self
confident
French
then
again
like
a
man
weary
but
unflinching
in
the
fulfillment
of
duty
he
rose
to
see
some
visitors
off
and
stroking
his
scanty
gray
hairs
over
his
bald
patch
also
asked
them
to
dinner
Sometimes
on
his
way
back
from
the
anteroom
he
would
pass
through
the
conservatory
and
pantry
into
the
large
marble
dining
hall
where
tables
were
being
set
out
for
eighty
people
and
looking
at
the
footmen
who
were
bringing
in
silver
and
china
moving
tables
and
unfolding
damask
table
linen
he
would
call
Dmitri
Vasilevich
a
man
of
good
family
and
the
manager
of
all
his
affairs
and
while
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
enormous
table
would
say
Well
Dmitri
you
ll
see
that
things
are
all
as
they
should
be
That
s
right
The
great
thing
is
the
serving
that
s
it
And
with
a
complacent
sigh
he
would
return
to
the
drawing
room
Marya
Lvovna
Karagina
and
her
daughter
announced
the
countess
gigantic
footman
in
his
bass
voice
entering
the
drawing
room
The
countess
reflected
a
moment
and
took
a
pinch
from
a
gold
snuffbox
with
her
husband
s
portrait
on
it
I
m
quite
worn
out
by
these
callers
However
I
ll
see
her
and
no
more
She
is
so
affected
Ask
her
in
she
said
to
the
footman
in
a
sad
voice
as
if
saying
Very
well
finish
me
off
A
tall
stout
and
proud
looking
woman
with
a
round
faced
smiling
daughter
entered
the
drawing
room
their
dresses
rustling
Dear
Countess
what
an
age
She
has
been
laid
up
poor
child
at
the
Razumovski
s
ball
and
Countess
Apraksina
I
was
so
delighted
came
the
sounds
of
animated
feminine
voices
interrupting
one
another
and
mingling
with
the
rustling
of
dresses
and
the
scraping
of
chairs
Then
one
of
those
conversations
began
which
last
out
until
at
the
first
pause
the
guests
rise
with
a
rustle
of
dresses
and
say
I
am
so
delighted
Mamma
s
health
and
Countess
Apraksina
and
then
again
rustling
pass
into
the
anteroom
put
on
cloaks
or
mantles
and
drive
away
The
conversation
was
on
the
chief
topic
of
the
day
the
illness
of
the
wealthy
and
celebrated
beau
of
Catherine
s
day
Count
Bezukhov
and
about
his
illegitimate
son
Pierre
the
one
who
had
behaved
so
