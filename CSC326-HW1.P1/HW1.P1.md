This assignment helps me to understand how to develop a web application using grunt, bower and jQuery. It shows how grunt exectes gruntFile and its tasks for automatic build. It also help me learn how to build an interactive webpage using jQuery.

For the bonus part, I created a validation task using jshint and created a jQuery button which when being clicked it shows and hides the picture in the webpage.
